🇬🇧 GoHu Servitor 

This short essay is an account of one of my most successful servitors to date. The twin spirits of gossip and rumour have followed me about ever since I started doing things　on the UK magical scene. Rumours ranging from allegations of affiliation to dark satanic groups to upheavals in my sex-life have whirled around and in some instances, ended up in the pages of pagan 'zines. Back in the late 80's, Pagan At The Heart magazine announced to their readers that I had become celibate, and followed this up with the announcement that they could name the lady who overcame my will - unfortunately, they got not only the name but also the gender of the person concerned wrong, but I suppose it's the thought that counts!

At times I have become both paranoid and pissed off by the rumours I heard circulating about myself. During a particularly bad phase of feeling like this, I started working on a Gossip Hunter-Seeker-Killer servitor, whose task would be to hover around on the astral, detecting gossip and firing off a missile containing some suitably horrible runic curse. I actually got as far as testing this entity - firing off a blank missile at an unsuspecting colleague - just to see if it worked the way I wanted it to - before realising that I was going a teensy wee bit over the top about the whole thing.

Instead of thinking, 'Get the Bastards' I began to look at the whole issue of gossip & rumour in a new light. After all, if people are talking about you behind your back, they could be said to be feeding you energy. As Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman wisely note in Good Omens: Notoriety wasn't as good as fame, but was heaps better than obscurity. Bearing this in mind, I decided to create a servitor that actively worked to generate gossip and rumour, rather than counter it. After all, what's worse, being talked about - or not being talked about? Those magicians who leap to the defensive of their parent organisation every time someone drops a snide remark about them being paranoid would do well to remember this, and count themselves bloody lucky that people bother to think about them at all! I do remember, whilst being a member of a certain large international magical order, some guy approaching me and hesitantly asking Is it true that to join the *.*.*. you have to be able to visualise an object so that other people can see it too? Naturally I said nothing to deny or confirm this. Of course, this is the sort of rumour one likes to hear about one's organisation. But if you want people to think this sort of thing, you also have to be prepared to accept the people who accuse you of being closet Christians or not eating babies or whatever. Its' a sort of Dayside/ Backside Tree of Life metaphor, I guess. Particularly as if you continually deny anything that's even a bit dodgy, people will suss out that you re talking through your backside. A few years ago, at the Oxford Thelemic Symposium, a delegation from the Temple of Set did a presentation on how nice they really all were. Their spokesperson mentioned some of the rumours circulating - animal sacrifices, rent boys, drugs etc. and dismissed them all, saying that the TOS had been unfairly maligned. Sitting there, I thought, well what's the point then? I'd have been more impressed if they'd said - Yes we do do unspeakable rituals with sheep and street urchins - and WHY NOT?

Anyhow, I ended up deciding that gossip about me was, by and large, not all that bad. Not only are people feeding me 'power', they 're also doing some P.R. - and (though this is stretching the idea somewhat) - some of the rumours might act like a kind of enchantment - without me having to do anything. I'd already heard two rumours about me owning various shops in Leeds, you see. So GoHu's task was to encourage people to talk about me, and generate rumours - and ensure that I got to hear about it eventually. Now as I've said, by the time I got around to doing this, there was some level of gossip/rumour being generated anyway. So all GoHu had to act as a kind of 'amplifier' as well as receiving rumours and beaming them in my direction.

The Rumours

Since GoHu became active, the following tales have reached back to my shell-like ears:

1. That I have a castle in the South of France (!)
2. That I own the Atlantis Bookshop in London (!)
3. That I am, in reality, Peter J. Carroll (!!)
4. That I was putting in a bid to buy a Goth nightclub in Birmingham (someone actually rang me up to ask me if this was 'true' (!)
5. That I apparently sodomize former Chaos International editor Ian Read on a regular basis.(!)
6. That I am a blood-drinking 'vampire' - this 'fact' is recounted in 2 books - Hearts of Darkness by John Parker (a socalled 'investigative journalist' who purports to examine modern occultism - in the wake of the 'Satanic Child Abus' scare) and The Worlds Greatest Unsolved Mysteries - I forget the authors offhand, but they are involved with ASSAP and the Society for Psychical Research. This one stems from a short story which deals with vampiric themes ublished in Chaos International, entitled Droplets. As it was written in the first person, apparently some people have chosen to believe it was me baring my soul. Oh dear!

🇯🇵 GoHu サーヴィター

この短いエッセイでは、私がこれまでに創造したサーヴィターの中でも、特に成功を収めたひとつについて語る。

ゴシップと噂という双子の精霊（twin spirits）は、私がイギリスの魔術界で活動を始めた頃から、常に私につきまとってきた。
暗黒サタニズムのグループとつながっているという憶測から、私の性生活が荒れているといった内容まで──
さまざまな噂が飛び交い、その一部は実際にペイガン系のZine誌にまで掲載されることとなった。

たとえば1980年代後半、雑誌『Pagan At The Heart』は読者に向けて「フィル・ハインは禁欲主義者になった」と発表し、
さらにその後「彼の禁欲の誓いを打ち破った女性の名前を特定できる」とまで書いた。
……が、残念ながら彼らはその人物の名前だけでなく性別まで間違えていた。
まあ、「気持ちが大事」ってやつだろうけど！

噂が自分のまわりで飛び交っているのを耳にするたびに、私は偏執的になったり、ぶち切れたりしていた。

そんな感情がピークに達した時期、私はこんなサーヴィターの開発に取りかかった。
名づけて──「ゴシップ追跡・狩猟・殲滅型（Gossip Hunter-Seeker-Killer）サーヴィター」。

その任務は、アストラル空間をうろつきながらゴシップを探知し、しかるべき“おぞましいルーン呪詛”を詰め込んだミサイルをぶっ放すことだった。

実際、私はこの存在をテスト運用するところまでいった。
ある同僚に向けて空砲ミサイルを撃ってみたのだ──その動作が意図通りに機能するか確認するために。

……が、しばらくしてようやく気づいた。
「ちょっと、これはさすがにやりすぎじゃない？」ってね。

「連中をぶちのめせ」なんて考えるかわりに、私はゴシップと噂という現象をまったく別の観点から見直すことにした。
だってよく考えてみれば、人が自分の陰口をたたいているというのは──ある意味で自分にエネルギーを注いでいるとも言えるんじゃないか？

テリー・プラチェットとニール・ゲイマンが『グッド・オーメンズ』でこう書いている：

「悪名は名声には及ばないが、無名よりはずっとマシだ」──と。

これを踏まえて、私は噂を打ち消すのではなく、むしろ生成を促すサーヴィターを作ることにした。
だって結局のところ──「悪く言われること」と「そもそも話題にされないこと」、どっちがマシだ？

組織についての皮肉や中傷が出るたびに、条件反射で防衛モードに入るような魔術師たちは、この点をもう少しよく考えた方がいい。
少なくとも人が自分のことを考えてくれている──ってだけで、ありがたく思うべきだ。

そういえば昔、ある国際的大規模魔術結社に属していたとき、
ある男が私に近づいてきて、恐る恐るこう尋ねてきたんだ：

「……その……..*.*に入会するには、視覚化した物体を他人に“見せられる”くらいじゃないとダメって、本当ですか？」

当然ながら、私は肯定も否定もしなかった。

こういう噂こそ、自分の組織について語られるならむしろ嬉しくなる類の話だ。
だが、こういった魅力的な神秘性を維持したいなら、「おまえらってキリスト教徒の隠れ信者だろ？」とか「赤ん坊食ってないだろ？」とか言ってくる輩にも付き合う覚悟が必要なのだ。

いわばこれは、生命の樹の表側（Dayside）と裏側（Backside）のようなメタファーなんじゃないかと思う。

とくに「やましいことなんて何もしてないです！」なんて必死で否定しつづける人間は、そのうち誰もが“あ、こいつウソついてるな”って気づいてしまうものだ。

数年前のことだが、オックスフォードで開催されたテレマのシンポジウムにて、**テンプル・オブ・セット（ToS）**の一団がプレゼンを行い、
「自分たちは本当にいい人たちなんです」とアピールしていた。

代表者は、動物の生贄、売春少年、ドラッグなどの噂について触れ、「不当に中傷されてきたのだ」と断言していた。

……私はそれを聞いてこう思った：

「じゃあ、いったい何が面白いんだ？」

もし彼らが、「ええ、もちろんやってますよ──羊とストリートチルドレンを使った口に出せない儀式を──で、それが何か？」と言っていたら、
私はきっともっと感心していたに違いない。

ありがとうございます。この段落では、ついに「GoHu」というサーヴィターのコンセプトが完成し、“噂を受信・増幅・フィードバックするエンチャント装置”として設計されたことが明かされます。
前段までのユーモアと皮肉を引き継ぎつつ、ここでは 「ゴシップ＝無償の魔術効果」 というカオス的着眼点が明確に示されます。

GoHu を稼働させて以来、私の耳に届いた“噂”の数々は以下の通り：

私は南フランスにお城を持っているらしい（！）

ロンドンのアトランティス書店は私の所有物らしい（！）

実は私こそがピーター・J・キャロル本人である（！！）

バーミンガムのゴス系ナイトクラブを買収しようとしているらしい（しかも、誰かがこの件について「本当か？」と電話してきた！）

私はカオス・インターナショナル誌の元編集者イアン・リードを定期的にソドミーしているらしい（！）

私は“血を飲む吸血鬼”である──この“事実”は以下の2冊の本にも記載されている：

『Hearts of Darkness』（ジョン・パーカー著）──いわゆる“調査報道ジャーナリスト”による現代オカルティズムの暴露本。サタニック・チャイルド・アビューズ騒動の流れで書かれた。

『The World’s Greatest Unsolved Mysteries』（著者は失念したが、ASSAPや心霊研究協会に関係している人たち）

この吸血鬼説の出どころは、私が『Chaos International』に書いた短編小説『Droplets』（吸血鬼をテーマにした物語）らしい。
しかもそれが一人称視点で書かれていたために、「これはハイン本人が自白したに違いない！」と信じ込む人が出てきたらしい……。

ああ、なんてこった！
