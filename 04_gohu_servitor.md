🇬🇧 GoHu Servitor 

This short essay is an account of one of my most successful servitors to date. The twin spirits of gossip and rumour have followed me about ever since I started doing things　on the UK magical scene. Rumours ranging from allegations of affiliation to dark satanic groups to upheavals in my sex-life have whirled around and in some instances, ended up in the pages of pagan 'zines. Back in the late 80's, Pagan At The Heart magazine announced to their readers that I had become celibate, and followed this up with the announcement that they could name the lady who overcame my will - unfortunately, they got not only the name but also the gender of the person concerned wrong, but I suppose it's the thought that counts!

At times I have become both paranoid and pissed off by the rumours I heard circulating about myself. During a particularly bad phase of feeling like this, I started working on a Gossip Hunter-Seeker-Killer servitor, whose task would be to hover around on the astral, detecting gossip and firing off a missile containing some suitably horrible runic curse. I actually got as far as testing this entity - firing off a blank missile at an unsuspecting colleague - just to see if it worked the way I wanted it to - before realising that I was going a teensy wee bit over the top about the whole thing.

Instead of thinking, 'Get the Bastards' I began to look at the whole issue of gossip & rumour in a new light. After all, if people are talking about you behind your back, they could be said to be feeding you energy. As Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman wisely note in Good Omens: Notoriety wasn't as good as fame, but was heaps better than obscurity. Bearing this in mind, I decided to create a servitor that actively worked to generate gossip and rumour, rather than counter it. After all, what's worse, being talked about - or not being talked about? Those magicians who leap to the defensive of their parent organisation every time someone drops a snide remark about them being paranoid would do well to remember this, and count themselves bloody lucky that people bother to think about them at all! I do remember, whilst being a member of a certain large international magical order, some guy approaching me and hesitantly asking Is it true that to join the *.*.*. you have to be able to visualise an object so that other people can see it too? Naturally I said nothing to deny or confirm this. Of course, this is the sort of rumour one likes to hear about one's organisation. But if you want people to think this sort of thing, you also have to be prepared to accept the people who accuse you of being closet Christians or not eating babies or whatever. Its' a sort of Dayside/ Backside Tree of Life metaphor, I guess. Particularly as if you continually deny anything that's even a bit dodgy, people will suss out that you re talking through your backside. A few years ago, at the Oxford Thelemic Symposium, a delegation from the Temple of Set did a presentation on how nice they really all were. Their spokesperson mentioned some of the rumours circulating - animal sacrifices, rent boys, drugs etc. and dismissed them all, saying that the TOS had been unfairly maligned. Sitting there, I thought, well what's the point then? I'd have been more impressed if they'd said - Yes we do do unspeakable rituals with sheep and street urchins - and WHY NOT?

Anyhow, I ended up deciding that gossip about me was, by and large, not all that bad. Not only are people feeding me 'power', they 're also doing some P.R. - and (though this is stretching the idea somewhat) - some of the rumours might act like a kind of enchantment - without me having to do anything. I'd already heard two rumours about me owning various shops in Leeds, you see. So GoHu's task was to encourage people to talk about me, and generate rumours - and ensure that I got to hear about it eventually. Now as I've said, by the time I got around to doing this, there was some level of gossip/rumour being generated anyway. So all GoHu had to act as a kind of 'amplifier' as well as receiving rumours and beaming them in my direction.

The Rumours

Since GoHu became active, the following tales have reached back to my shell-like ears:

1. That I have a castle in the South of France (!)
2. That I own the Atlantis Bookshop in London (!)
3. That I am, in reality, Peter J. Carroll (!!)
4. That I was putting in a bid to buy a Goth nightclub in Birmingham (someone actually rang me up to ask me if this was 'true' (!)
5. That I apparently sodomize former Chaos International editor Ian Read on a regular basis.(!)
6. That I am a blood-drinking 'vampire' - this 'fact' is recounted in 2 books - Hearts of Darkness by John Parker (a socalled 'investigative journalist' who purports to examine modern occultism - in the wake of the 'Satanic Child Abus' scare) and The Worlds Greatest Unsolved Mysteries - I forget the authors offhand, but they are involved with ASSAP and the Society for Psychical Research. This one stems from a short story which deals with vampiric themes ublished in Chaos International, entitled Droplets. As it was written in the first person, apparently some people have chosen to believe it was me baring my soul. Oh dear!

🇯🇵 GoHu サーヴィター

この短いエッセイは、私がこれまで手掛けた中で最も成功したサーヴァントの1つについての報告です。噂とゴシップの双子の霊は、私がイギリスの魔法界で「活動」を始めて以来、常に私につきまとってきました。サタニックなグループとの関与を指摘する噂から、私の性生活における混乱まで、様々な噂が渦巻き、一部はペイガンのジン誌の頁に載るまでになりました。80年代後半、Pagan At The Heart誌は読者に対し、私が「独身」になったと発表し、さらに私の意志を打ち破った「女性」の名前を明かすと続けた。残念ながら、彼らはその人物の名前だけでなく性別も間違えたが、おそらく「気持ち」が大切なのでしょう！
自分について流れる噂に、 paranoid（偏執的）で pissed off（腹立たしい）になることもあった。特に気分が悪い時期には、ゴシップハンター・シーカー・キラーというサーヴァントを作成し始めた。その任務は、アストラル界を漂いながらゴシップを検知し、適切な恐ろしいルーンの呪いを込めたミサイルを発射することだった。実際にこの存在を「テスト」までしたんだ——無防備な同僚に「空砲」のミサイルを発射して、思った通りに動くかどうか確認した——でも、結局、このアイデアが少しばかり過剰だったことに気づいたんだ。
「あの野郎どもを倒せ」と考える代わりに、噂と噂の全体像を新しい視点で見るようになったんだ。畢竟、人々があなたの後ろで話しているなら、彼らはあなたにエネルギーを与えていると言える。テリー・プラチェットとニール・ゲイマンが『グッド・オメンズ』で賢く指摘しているように：「悪名は大いなる名声には及ばないが、無名よりははるかにましだ」。この点を念頭に置き、私は噂や噂を積極的に生成するサーヴァントを作成することに決めた。結局のところ、話されることか、話されないことか、どちらが最悪だろうか？親組織を擁護するために、誰かが彼らをパラノイアだと皮肉るたびに防御的になる魔法使いたちは、このことを覚えておくべきだ。そして、人々が彼らについて考えること自体に、幸運だと感謝すべきだ！ある大規模な国際魔法団体に所属していた頃、ある男が私に近づき、ためらいながら「*.*.*.に入会するには、他人が見えるように物体を視覚化できる必要があるというのは本当か？」と尋ねたことを覚えている。当然、私は否定も肯定もせず、何も言わなかった。もちろん、これは自分の組織について聞きたいような噂だ。しかし、人々がこのようなことを考えるようにしたいなら、あなたが隠れキリスト教徒だ、赤ん坊を食べない、などといった非難を受ける覚悟も必要だ。これは、おそらく「昼の面/夜の面の生命の木」のメタファーのようなものだろう。特に、少しでも怪しいことを常に否定していると、人々はあなたが嘘をついていると気づく。数年前のオックスフォード・テレミック・シンポジウムで、セットの寺院の代表団が、彼らが本当に親切な人々であるというプレゼンテーションを行った。彼らのスポークスマンは、動物の犠牲、売春少年、薬物など、流れている噂の一部を挙げ、それらをすべて否定し、TOSが不当に中傷されていると述べた。私はそこに座って、では何の意味があるのだろうと思った。もし彼らが「はい、私たちは羊とストリートチルドレンを使った言葉にできない儀式を行っています——なぜなら、なぜそうしないのか？」と言った方が、私はもっと感心しただろう。
いずれにせよ、私は自分に関する噂は、おおむねそれほど悪いものではないと結論付けた。人々は私に「力」を与えているだけでなく、PRもしてくれているからだ。- そして（これは少し無理があるかもしれないが）- いくつかの噂は、私が何もせずに魔法のような効果を発揮するかもしれない。実は、私はリーズに様々な店を所有しているという噂を既に二つ聞いていた。だから、GoHuの任務は、人々が私について話すように促し、噂を拡散させ、最終的に私がその噂を耳にするようにすることだった。しかし、私がこの作業に取り掛かった頃には、すでに一定の噂やゴシップが流れていた。そのため、GoHuは噂を受け取り、私の方向へ放つだけでなく、一種の「増幅器」としての役割も果たす必要があった。
噂
GoHuが活動を開始して以来、私の貝殻のような耳に届いた噂は以下の通りだ：
1. 私がフランスの南部に城を持っている （！）
2. ロンドンにアトランティス・ブックショップを所有している （！）
3. 実はピーター・J・キャロルである （！！）
4. バーミンガムのゴシックナイトクラブを購入する入札をしていた（実際に電話がかかってきて、これが
「本当か」と尋ねられた！）
5. チャオス・インターナショナルの元編集長イアン・リードを定期的に強姦している（！）
6. 私は血を飲む「吸血鬼」だ - この「事実」は2冊の本で記述されている - 『Hearts of Darkness』ジョン・パーカー（現代のオカルティズムを調査する「調査ジャーナリスト」を自称する人物 - 「サタニック・チャイルド・アビューズ」騒動の後に） 『The World's Greatest Unsolved Mysteries』——著者は思い出せないが、ASSAPと超常現象研究協会（Society for Psychical Research）に関与している。これは、カオス・インターナショナルに発表された吸血鬼をテーマにした短編小説『Droplets』に由来する。第一人称で書かれたため、どうやら一部の人々は、私が自分の魂をさらけ出したと信じたようだ。ああ、困った！
