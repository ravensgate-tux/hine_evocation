üá¨üáß Some Observations from The Goetia Project

The Goetia Project was the title of as long-term project undertaken by myself and a colleague in 1989. Our original aim was to work through a series of 'traditional' grimoires and, following assessments and analysis of our findings, create a general approach to Goetia suitable for our post-modern era. Needless to say, things did not go exactly as we planned.

Our first series of workings was drawn from the Lesser Key of Solomon. Our first evocation, of the spirit Vassago, was performed without using the traditional arrangement of circle, triangle, etc. Just to see what happened, as it were. The result was that the working lacked clear definition; visions of the spirit called forth were hazy at best, and we both experienced a lowering of vitality (a feeling of being 'drained'), headaches and pre-flulike symptoms for a couple of days following. In view of this, we constructed a permanent circle and triangle, according to the 'rules' in the lesser Key, and all workings were conducted in the fashion outlined in the lesser Key.

Using the long conjurations and constraints to the spirit given punctuated by the Old Testament names of God and Biblical quotations, quickly raises excitement to a fever pitch, and once the spirit can be discerned, it must then be abjured to remain within the Triangle of Art. The shapes which the spirits assumed were rarely exactly that described within the lesser Key (hereafter LK), but generally similar. We found that once a spirit had appeared to us in a particular form, then it more or less took that shape in subsequent evocations.

Once evoked, a spirit would then be questioned bout its nature, qualities, and how we could improve upon the evocationenvironment. In one instance, we uestioned the spirit Vassago about the optimum time for evoking him. He made reply by showing us a sundial, hourglass and skull. We further tested him by requiring him to give me a vision of where my colleague would be the following afternoon. I was promptly given a clear vision of walking through long corridors filled with people and lined with lockers, of going up a flight of stairs and walking into a room, which was full of boxes - but at this point, the vision became unclear. My colleague later told me that the building I had 'seen' was Leeds Polytechnic, and that the room with 'boxes' (where the vision had become unclear) was he computer department! This led us to feel that computers were outside the experience of Vassago, as were digital watches.

Whilst working through the series of evocations we also attempted various modifications to the conjurations. Invocation of appropriate God-forms, such as orus, prior to beginning the evocatory process, seemed to make the conjuration of spirits such as Haures or Andromelius easier. During an evocation of Glasyglabolas, we preceded the conjurations with an invocation of chaos, The Unsealing of the Vortices, which was originally designed for a series of Eris workings. As we did this, a windstorm blew up about the house we were working in, but the spirit we were attempting to conjure flickered in and out ofthe triangle. It seemed to us that the 'energies' created by the Vortices was impeding the spirit's ability to manifest, so we closed them, the windstorm dropped away, and the spirit came through into the triangle.

Incidents such as these led us to postulate that the LK spirits tended to a certain degree of conservatism over the parameters within which they could he cal led forth. The visions that they imparted to us concerning the optimum environment for conjuration definitely belonged to the 'baroque' school of magic - cellars, clouds of incense, lots of paraphernalia etc.
