🇬🇧 Servitors 

A Servitor is an entity consciously created or generated, using evocatory techniques, to perform a task or service. In the Western Esoteric Tradition, such entities are sometimes referred to as 'Thought-Forms', whilst in Tibetan magic, for example, they are known as 'Tulpas'. Servitors can be usefully deployed perform a wide range of tasks or functions on your behalf. Servitors can be created to work with one particular situation or event or, alternatively, Servitors can be created which have a general provenance in one area, such as healing. There are a number of advantages to using more generalised Servitors. Firstly, they can be regarded as expert systems which learn from being given a task to execute - as if the more healing tasks you give a servitor, the better it seems to become at healing. Secondly,continued use of the Servitor, with successful results, builds up 'confidence' in it's activity on the part of those who use it. With a more generalised Servitor, anyone who knows its activation sequence (such as a mantra, sigil, or visualisation sequence) can employ it to work at a given task. One example of this form of Servitor is the entity ICANDOO. ICANDOO (I-can-do) was created at an open group workshop in Servitor creation. The name of the Servitor was also its mantra for summoning it, and it's general brief was to assist those who used it for overcoming any obstacles that crossed them. ICANDOO was created by a group of 12 people, and all of them used the Servitor throughout the day, to assist them with problems of one sort or another. In the design sequence, the Servitor was given the ability to divide itself holographically, so that each segment contained the powers and abilities of the original entity.

On a still further level of generalisation, you can create Servitors who have no specific function or provenance, saving that they serve to increase the success of one's own magics. Such servitors can be used in both major and minor acts of magic, and are particularly useful in acts of enchantment, divination, or illumination. Servitor Dependency It is generally held that each usage of a Servitor serves to feed it, and that each result which is rated as a success, serves to enhance it's power. It is also a good idea to get into the habit of attributing any occurrences within the sphere of activity of that Servitor, to it's work. This can lead to problems, though. In 1992 I created a Servitor called Eureka. It's given sphere of activity was that of Illumination - inspiration, new ideas, the boosting of creativity and brainstorming in general. Initially, the Servitor exceeded all my expectations of it's performance. I used it to stimulate new ideas for writing, lecturing and facilitating seminars & workshops. With a colleague, it became a focus for brainstorming - acting as a Third Mind arising from conversation. Each time we made a creative leap, or an idea formed became something workable in practice, the power of the Servitor was boosted. In 1993, the activity of Eureka was linked with the Neptune-Uranus conjunction with the result that, on April 22nd, as Neptune & Uranus began to retrograde, Eureka went offline.

The immediate result of this was that I suddenly found it much harder to get into a flow of creative thinking. It seemed that Eureka had become such a dominant element in the dynamics of my own creative process that, once it was removed, I found it much harder to get into the appropriate frame of mind. I had become dependent upon the Servitor. Eventually, the Servitor was recalled and disassembled in such a way that a illumination. Having been made wiser by this experience, I only occasionally use this fragment of the original servitor as a focus for creativity. Viral Servitors It is possible to instruct Servitors to replicate or reproduce themselves. Approaches to this include instructing the Servitor to replicate itself as a form of cell-division, replication which follows cybernetic or viral parameters, or to create a servitor which gives birth according to particular parameters, such as time-units, astrological transits, or each time the target of the Servitor carries out a particular behaviour. An early test of this concept was that of a Servitor despatched to assist in the recovery of property being withheld from it's owner. Once a set deadline had been passed, the Servitor began to generate a field of confusion - lost keys, electrical blowouts & other minor but annoying problems. After a second set deadline, the Servitor began to replicate itself, so that the confusion field generated was intensified. As soon as the recipient of the Servitor returned the property he had been withholding from it's owner, the Servitors ceased to function. Evidence of the Servitors action - the intensification of minor problems escalating into strange poltergeist-type phenomenon, was gathered by talking to associates of the target. Viral Servitors are particularly appropriate for long-term enchantments, such as increasing the probability of one's magic being successful, or being used in healing & general protection workings.

SERVITOR DESIGN SEQUENCE

1. Define General Intent

The first step in designing a Servitor is to decide the general sphere of influence into which your intention falls, such as healing, protection, binding, harmony, luck, divination, mood enhancement, success in ...., and so forth. Defining your general intent will assist you if you wish to use symbols & magical correspondences in creating your servitor. For example, if you were interested in creating a servitor to act within the sphere of Healing, then you could assemble any associations, symbols, emotions, memories, etc which you relate to the concept of Healing. By consulting a book of magical correspondences such as '777', you could build up chains of correspondences - planetary figures, scents, colours, planetary hours etc. How far you go in this direction is very much a matter of personal choice.

2. Defining Specific Intent

Here, you are creating the core of the Servitor's purpose the Statement of Intent which is analogous to the Servitor's aetheric DNA. Formulating the Servitor's Statement of Intent may necessitate a good deal of self-analysis into your motivations, desires, realistic projections of goals, etc. As in all sorcery operations, it is appropriate to ask advice from your preferred form of divination. To continue the example of a Healing Servitor, an appropriate Statement of Intent might be:
To promote rapid recovery and health in ...(name)... Once you have determined the appropriate Intent to form the basis of your Servitor, then the Statement can be rendered into a sigil, or glyph..

3. What Symbols Are Appropriate to the Servitor's Task?

There is a wealth of magical & mythic symbols which you can draw upon when creating a servitor, which can be used to represent different qualities, abilities and attributes. There is lso the symbolism of colour, smell, sound & other sensory media to draw upon. In order to refine the program which forms the basis for your servitor further, you could embellish the sigil by adding other symbols.

4. Is there a Time Factor to Consider?

Here, you should consider the duration of the Servitor's operation. In other words, do you want the Servitor to be working continuously, or only at specific periods? Here, you may wish to take into account phases of the moon, astrological conjunctions or planetary hours, for example, which could be added into the Servitor's symbolic instructions. The Healing Servitor above for example, was instructed to be active for a period of seven days, affecting it's target recipient for seven minutes, at seven hour intervals. This instruction serves to reinforce the number symbolism & association with harmony. It is also at this point that you should consider what happens after the Servitor has performed its task. It is generally held to be preferable that when a Servitor has completed its task, the Servitor should be disassembled by its creator. There are two approaches to doing this. Firstly, one can encode a self-destruct instruction into the Servitor at the time of it's creation, where the duration of its existence is defined in terms of the duration of its task, or the fulfilment of a specific condition. The other approach to disassembly is to perform a ritual reabsorption of the Servitor, mentally drawing it back from it's task, taking it apart by visualization, taking back the original desire which sparked it's creation, and taking apart or destroying any material base which you have created for it. Whilst classical occult theory has it that if you do not look after your thoughtforms,they will wander around the astral plane annoying people, there is good psychological sense for terminating the life of Servitors which have completed their assigned task - that you are reclaiming responsibility for that desire-complex which you used to create the Servitor.

5. Is A Name Required?

The Servitor can be given a name which can be used, in addition to its sigil, for creating, powering, or controlling it. A name also acts to further create a ervitor's persona. A name can reflect the Servitor's task, or be formed from a mantric sigil of it's Statement of Intent.

6. Is a Material Base Required?

The Material base is some physical focus for the Servitor's existence. This can help to define the Servitor as an individual entity, and can be used if you need to recall the Servitor for any reason. Examples of a material base include bottles, rings, crystals, small figurines as used in fantasy role-playing or figures crafted from modelling compounds. Bodily fluids can be applied to the material base to increase the perceived link between creator and entity. This is very much a matter of personal taste. Alternatively, the Servitor can remain freely mobile as an aetheric entity. I tend to find that one-shot, task-specific servitors can be left as aetheric entities, whilst for entities which have more of along-term use, a material base is often helpful. For others, it might be possible to link their use to a specific, identifiable, state of consciousness, which forms part of the core associations which one builds up for a Servitor. It is also possible to link a Servitor to a specific smell, such as a perfume or essential oil, so that each time the oil is applied, the Servitor is activated. This can be particularly useful when creating Servitors for general Healing, Protection, or enhancement of a particular mood. A dab of the perfume can be put onto the Servitor's material base, and the perfume should be inhaled during the launch of the entity.

7. Is a Specific Shape Required?

Servitors can be created to have any desired shape, from tiny homunculi to morphic spheres capable of extruding any required appendage. The shape you choose to  dentify with this particular thought-form can add another level of representational identity to the entity. A common practice though, is to visualize the Servitor as a featureless sphere, pulsing with energy, glowing with appropriately chosen colours, into which has been impressed, it's sigilised instructions.

🇯🇵 サーヴィター

サービターは、召喚術を用いて意識的に創造または生成された存在で、特定の任務やサービスを行うために使用される。西洋の秘教伝統では、このような存在は「思考形態」と呼ばれることがある。一方、チベットの魔術では「トゥルパ」と呼ばれる。サービターは、あなた behalf で多様な任務や機能を果たすために有効に活用できる。サービターは、特定の状況やイベントに対応するように作成されることもあれば、ヒーリングのような特定の分野で汎用的に使用されるように作成されることもある。汎用的なサービターを使用するメリットはいくつかある。まず、サービターは「エキスパート・システム」と見なすことができ、与えられたタスクを実行する過程で学習する。例えば、サービターにヒーリングのタスクを多く与えるほど、そのヒーリング能力が向上するようだ。第二に、サービターを継続的に使用し、成功を収めることで、使用者がその活動に対して「信頼」を築くことができる。汎用性の高いサービターの場合、その起動シーケンス（マントラ、シジル、または視覚化シーケンスなど）を知っている人なら誰でも、特定のタスクに活用することができる。この形式のサービターの例として、エンティティ「ICANDOO」がある。ICANDOO（「I-can-do」）は、サービター作成のオープンワークショップで作成された。サービターの名前は召喚のマントラでもあり、その一般的な役割は、使用者が直面する障害を克服するのを助けることだった。ICANDOOは12人のグループによって作成され、全員が一日中サービターを使用し、様々な問題の解決に役立てた。デザイン段階では、サービターにホログラフィックに分裂する能力が与えられ、各セグメントが元のエンティティの能力と力を保持するように設計された。
さらに抽象化したレベルでは、特定の機能や起源を持たないサービターを作成でき、その目的は使用者の魔法の成功率を向上させることだけだ。このようなサービターは、主要な魔法行為と minor acts of magic の両方で使用でき、特に enchantment、divination、または illumination において有用だ。
サービターの依存関係一般的に、サービターの各使用はそれを「養う」とされ、成功と評価された結果は、その力を強化すると考えられている。また、そのサービターの活動範囲内で発生するあらゆる出来事を、そのサービターの働きに帰属させる習慣をつけることも良い考えだ。ただし、これには問題が生じる可能性もある。1992年に、私は「エウレカ」という名のサービターを作成した。その活動範囲は「照明」——創造性の向上、新しいアイデアの生成、ブレインストーミングの促進——とされた。当初、サービターの性能は私の期待を遥かに超えていた。私はそれを執筆、講演、セミナーやワークショップのファシリテーションのための新しいアイデアの刺激に利用した。同僚と共に、それは会話から生まれる「第三の心」としてブレインストーミングの焦点となった。創造的な飛躍を遂げたり、アイデアが実践可能な形になったたびに、サービターの力は強化された。1993年、ユーリカの活動は海王星と天王星の合と結びつき、その結果、4月22日に海王星と天王星が逆行し始めた際、ユーリカは「オフライン」になった。
」
この直後の結果として、私は突然、創造的な思考の流れに入りづらくなった。ユーリカが私の創造的プロセスのダイナミクスにおいて支配的な要素となっていたため、それが取り除かれると、適切な心の状態に入るのが格段に困難になった。私はサービターに依存していたのだ。最終的に、サービターは回収され、分解された。この経験から教訓を得た私は、現在ではオリジナルのサービターの断片を、創造性の焦点として偶にしか使用していない。ウイルス型サービターサービターに自身を複製または再生産するように指示することは可能です。このアプローチには、サービターに細胞分裂のような形で自身を複製させる、サイバネティックまたはウイルスのパラメーターに従った複製を行う、または特定のパラメーター（時間単位、占星術のトランジット、またはターゲットのサービターが特定の行動を行うたびに）に従って「出産」するサービターを作成するなどが含まれます。
サービターが特定の行動を行うたびに、特定のパラメーターに従って「出産」するサービターを作成することなどがある。この概念の初期のテストでは、所有者から奪われた財産を取り戻すために派遣されたサービターが使用された。設定された期限が過ぎると、サービターは「混乱」のフィールドを生成し始めた——鍵の紛失、電気系統の故障、その他の minor だが煩わしい問題が発生した。2つ目の期限が過ぎると、サービターは自身を複製し始め、生成される混乱のフィールドが強化された。サービターの受取人が所有者から奪っていた財産を返却すると、サービターは機能停止した。サービターの行動の証拠——軽微な問題がエスカレートして奇妙なポルターガイスト現象に発展した——は、標的の関連者との会話から収集された。ウイルス型サービターは、魔法の成功確率を上げる、ヒーリングや一般的な保護作業に使用するなど、長期的な魔法に特に適している。
サービター設計手順
1. 一般的な意図を定義する
サービターを設計する最初のステップは、あなたの意図が属する一般的な影響領域を決定することだ。例えば、癒し、保護、束縛、調和、幸運、占術、気分向上、成功などだ。一般的な意図を定義することは、サービターを作成する際、シンボルや魔法の対応関係を使用する場合に役立つ。例えば、癒しの領域で機能するサービターを作成したい場合、癒しに関連するあらゆる関連性、シンボル、感情、記憶などを集めることができる。魔法の対応表の書籍（例：'777'）を参照することで、惑星の図形、香り、色、惑星の時間など、対応の連鎖を構築することができる。この方向性に進む程度は、個人の選択に大きく依存する。
2. 具体的な意図の定義
ここでは、サービターの目的の核心である「意図の声明」を作成する。これはサービターのエーテル的DNAに相当する。サービターの「意図の声明」を策定するには、自身の動機、欲望、現実的な目標の投影などへの自己分析が求められる。すべての魔術操作と同様に、好みの占術形式で助言を求めることが適切だ。ヒーリング・サービターの例を続けると、適切な意図の声明は次のようなものになるかもしれない：
「...（名前）...の迅速な回復と健康を促進する」サービターの基盤となる適切な意図を決定したら、その声明をシジルやグリフに表現することができる。
3. サービターの任務に適切なシンボルとは？
サーヴァントを作成する際には、さまざまな品質、能力、属性を表すために利用できる魔法的・神話的なシンボルが豊富に存在する。色、臭い、音、その他の感覚メディアの象徴性も活用できる。サーヴァントの基盤となる「プログラム」をさらに精緻化するため、シジルに他のシンボルを追加して装飾することもできる。
4. 時間的要因は考慮すべきか？
ここでは、サービターの動作期間を考慮する必要があります。つまり、サービターを継続的に動作させたいのか、特定の期間のみ動作させたいのかを決定する必要があります。例えば、月の周期、占星術の合、惑星の時間など、サービターの象徴的な指示に組み込むことができる要素を考慮すると良いでしょう。上記のヒーリング・サービターは、7日間の期間中に、7時間ごとに7分間、対象者に影響を与えるように指示されている。この指示は、数字の象徴性と調和との関連性を強化する役割を果たしている。また、この段階で、サービターが任務を完了した後の処理についても検討する必要がある。一般的には、サービターが任務を完了した後は、作成者によって分解されることが望ましいとされている。これには2つのアプローチがある。まず、サービターを作成する際に「自己破壊指示」をエンコードし、その存在期間を任務の期間または特定の条件の達成で定義する方法だ。もう一つの分解方法は、サービターを精神的に任務から引き戻し、視覚化によって分解し、その創造のきっかけとなった元の欲望を取り戻し、作成した物質的な基盤を分解または破壊する「再吸収の儀式」を行うことだ。古典的なオカルト理論では、思考形態を適切に管理しないと、それらがアストラル平面を徘徊して人々を煩わせるとされていますが、任務を完了したサービターの「生命」を終了させることは、心理的に合理的な意味があります。つまり、サービターを創造するために使用した欲望の複合体を、再び責任として取り戻すことだからです。
5. 名前は必要か？
サービターには、シジルに加えて、作成、活性化、または制御するために使用できる名前を付けることができる。名前は、サービターのパーソナリティをさらに形成する役割も果たす。名前はサービターの任務を反映させたり、その意図の声明からマントラ的なシジルを形成して作成することもできる。
6. 物質的な基盤は必要か？
物質的基盤は、サービターの存在のための物理的な焦点です。これはサービターを個々の存在として定義するのに役立ち、何らかの理由でサービターを呼び戻す必要がある場合に使用できます。物質的基盤の例には、ボトル、指輪、クリスタル、ファンタジーロールプレイングで使用される小さなフィギュア、モデリング化合物から作成されたフィギュアなどが含まれます。物質的基盤に身体の液体を塗布することで、創造者と実体との間のつながりを強化できます。これは完全に個人の好みによる。代わりに、サービターをエーテル的な存在として自由に移動させても構わない。私は、単発のタスクに特化したサービターはエーテル的な存在のままにしておく方が良いと感じているが、長期的な用途がある存在の場合は、物質的な基盤がある方が役立つことが多い。他の場合、サービターの使用を特定の識別可能な意識状態にリンクさせることも可能だ。これは、サービターに対して構築する核心的な関連性の部分となる。また、サービターを特定の匂い（香水やエッセンシャルオイルなど）にリンクさせることも可能で、オイルを塗布するたびにサービターが活性化される。これは、一般的なヒーリング、保護、または特定の気分を強化するためのサービターを作成する際、特に有用だ。香水の少量をサービターの素材ベースに塗り、エンティティの起動時に香水を吸入する。
7. 特定の形状は必要ですか？
サービターは、小さなホムンクルスから、必要な付属物を生成できる形態変化可能な球体まで、任意の形状で作成できる。この思考形態と関連付ける形状を選択することは、エンティティに追加の表現的アイデンティティを加えることができる。一般的な実践としては、サービターを特徴のない球体として可視化し、エネルギーで脈打つように輝き、適切に選択された色で光り、その中に刻印された記号化された指示が刻み込まれているイメージを描くことだ。
