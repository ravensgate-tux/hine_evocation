🇬🇧 Servitors 

A Servitor is an entity consciously created or generated, using evocatory techniques, to perform a task or service. In the Western Esoteric Tradition, such entities are sometimes referred to as 'Thought-Forms', whilst in Tibetan magic, for example, they are known as 'Tulpas'. Servitors can be usefully deployed perform a wide range of tasks or functions on your behalf. Servitors can be created to work with one particular situation or event or, alternatively, Servitors can be created which have a general provenance in one area, such as healing. There are a number of advantages to using more generalised Servitors. Firstly, they can be regarded as expert systems which learn from being given a task to execute - as if the more healing tasks you give a servitor, the better it seems to become at healing. Secondly,continued use of the Servitor, with successful results, builds up 'confidence' in it's activity on the part of those who use it. With a more generalised Servitor, anyone who knows its activation sequence (such as a mantra, sigil, or visualisation sequence) can employ it to work at a given task. One example of this form of Servitor is the entity ICANDOO. ICANDOO (I-can-do) was created at an open group workshop in Servitor creation. The name of the Servitor was also its mantra for summoning it, and it's general brief was to assist those who used it for overcoming any obstacles that crossed them. ICANDOO was created by a group of 12 people, and all of them used the Servitor throughout the day, to assist them with problems of one sort or another. In the design sequence, the Servitor was given the ability to divide itself holographically, so that each segment contained the powers and abilities of the original entity.

On a still further level of generalisation, you can create Servitors who have no specific function or provenance, saving that they serve to increase the success of one's own magics. Such servitors can be used in both major and minor acts of magic, and are particularly useful in acts of enchantment, divination, or illumination. Servitor Dependency It is generally held that each usage of a Servitor serves to feed it, and that each result which is rated as a success, serves to enhance it's power. It is also a good idea to get into the habit of attributing any occurrences within the sphere of activity of that Servitor, to it's work. This can lead to problems, though. In 1992 I created a Servitor called Eureka. It's given sphere of activity was that of Illumination - inspiration, new ideas, the boosting of creativity and brainstorming in general. Initially, the Servitor exceeded all my expectations of it's performance. I used it to stimulate new ideas for writing, lecturing and facilitating seminars & workshops. With a colleague, it became a focus for brainstorming - acting as a Third Mind arising from conversation. Each time we made a creative leap, or an idea formed became something workable in practice, the power of the Servitor was boosted. In 1993, the activity of Eureka was linked with the Neptune-Uranus conjunction with the result that, on April 22nd, as Neptune & Uranus began to retrograde, Eureka went offline.

The immediate result of this was that I suddenly found it much harder to get into a flow of creative thinking. It seemed that Eureka had become such a dominant element in the dynamics of my own creative process that, once it was removed, I found it much harder to get into the appropriate frame of mind. I had become dependent upon the Servitor. Eventually, the Servitor was recalled and disassembled in such a way that a illumination. Having been made wiser by this experience, I only occasionally use this fragment of the original servitor as a focus for creativity. Viral Servitors It is possible to instruct Servitors to replicate or reproduce themselves. Approaches to this include instructing the Servitor to replicate itself as a form of cell-division, replication which follows cybernetic or viral parameters, or to create a servitor which gives birth according to particular parameters, such as time-units, astrological transits, or each time the target of the Servitor carries out a particular behaviour. An early test of this concept was that of a Servitor despatched to assist in the recovery of property being withheld from it's owner. Once a set deadline had been passed, the Servitor began to generate a field of confusion - lost keys, electrical blowouts & other minor but annoying problems. After a second set deadline, the Servitor began to replicate itself, so that the confusion field generated was intensified. As soon as the recipient of the Servitor returned the property he had been withholding from it's owner, the Servitors ceased to function. Evidence of the Servitors action - the intensification of minor problems escalating into strange poltergeist-type phenomenon, was gathered by talking to associates of the target. Viral Servitors are particularly appropriate for long-term enchantments, such as increasing the probability of one's magic being successful, or being used in healing & general protection workings.

SERVITOR DESIGN SEQUENCE

1. Define General Intent

The first step in designing a Servitor is to decide the general sphere of influence into which your intention falls, such as healing, protection, binding, harmony, luck, divination, mood enhancement, success in ...., and so forth. Defining your general intent will assist you if you wish to use symbols & magical correspondences in creating your servitor. For example, if you were interested in creating a servitor to act within the sphere of Healing, then you could assemble any associations, symbols, emotions, memories, etc which you relate to the concept of Healing. By consulting a book of magical correspondences such as '777', you could build up chains of correspondences - planetary figures, scents, colours, planetary hours etc. How far you go in this direction is very much a matter of personal choice.

2. Defining Specific Intent

Here, you are creating the core of the Servitor's purpose the Statement of Intent which is analogous to the Servitor's aetheric DNA. Formulating the Servitor's Statement of Intent may necessitate a good deal of self-analysis into your motivations, desires, realistic projections of goals, etc. As in all sorcery operations, it is appropriate to ask advice from your preferred form of divination. To continue the example of a Healing Servitor, an appropriate Statement of Intent might be:
To promote rapid recovery and health in ...(name)... Once you have determined the appropriate Intent to form the basis of your Servitor, then the Statement can be rendered into a sigil, or glyph..

3. What Symbols Are Appropriate to the Servitor's Task?

There is a wealth of magical & mythic symbols which you can draw upon when creating a servitor, which can be used to represent different qualities, abilities and attributes. There is lso the symbolism of colour, smell, sound & other sensory media to draw upon. In order to refine the program which forms the basis for your servitor further, you could embellish the sigil by adding other symbols.

4. Is there a Time Factor to Consider?

Here, you should consider the duration of the Servitor's operation. In other words, do you want the Servitor to be working continuously, or only at specific periods? Here, you may wish to take into account phases of the moon, astrological conjunctions or planetary hours, for example, which could be added into the Servitor's symbolic instructions. The Healing Servitor above for example, was instructed to be active for a period of seven days, affecting it's target recipient for seven minutes, at seven hour intervals. This instruction serves to reinforce the number symbolism & association with harmony. It is also at this point that you should consider what happens after the Servitor has performed its task. It is generally held to be preferable that when a Servitor has completed its task, the Servitor should be disassembled by its creator. There are two approaches to doing this. Firstly, one can encode a self-destruct instruction into the Servitor at the time of it's creation, where the duration of its existence is defined in terms of the duration of its task, or the fulfilment of a specific condition. The other approach to disassembly is to perform a ritual reabsorption of the Servitor, mentally drawing it back from it's task, taking it apart by visualization, taking back the original desire which sparked it's creation, and taking apart or destroying any material base which you have created for it. Whilst classical occult theory has it that if you do not look after your thoughtforms,they will wander around the astral plane annoying people, there is good psychological sense for terminating the life of Servitors which have completed their assigned task - that you are reclaiming responsibility for that desire-complex which you used to create the Servitor.

5. Is A Name Required?

The Servitor can be given a name which can be used, in addition to its sigil, for creating, powering, or controlling it. A name also acts to further create a ervitor's persona. A name can reflect the Servitor's task, or be formed from a mantric sigil of it's Statement of Intent.

6. Is a Material Base Required?

The Material base is some physical focus for the Servitor's existence. This can help to define the Servitor as an individual entity, and can be used if you need to recall the Servitor for any reason. Examples of a material base include bottles, rings, crystals, small figurines as used in fantasy role-playing or figures crafted from modelling compounds. Bodily fluids can be applied to the material base to increase the perceived link between creator and entity. This is very much a matter of personal taste. Alternatively, the Servitor can remain freely mobile as an aetheric entity. I tend to find that one-shot, task-specific servitors can be left as aetheric entities, whilst for entities which have more of along-term use, a material base is often helpful. For others, it might be possible to link their use to a specific, identifiable, state of consciousness, which forms part of the core associations which one builds up for a Servitor. It is also possible to link a Servitor to a specific smell, such as a perfume or essential oil, so that each time the oil is applied, the Servitor is activated. This can be particularly useful when creating Servitors for general Healing, Protection, or enhancement of a particular mood. A dab of the perfume can be put onto the Servitor's material base, and the perfume should be inhaled during the launch of the entity.

7. Is a Specific Shape Required?

Servitors can be created to have any desired shape, from tiny homunculi to morphic spheres capable of extruding any required appendage. The shape you choose to  dentify with this particular thought-form can add another level of representational identity to the entity. A common practice though, is to visualize the Servitor as a featureless sphere, pulsing with energy, glowing with appropriately chosen colours, into which has been impressed, it's sigilised instructions.

🇯🇵 サーヴィター

サーヴィター（Servitor）とは、ある任務や役割を遂行するために、喚起技法を用いて意識的に創造・生成された存在である。
西洋のエソテリック・トラディションにおいては、このような存在は「思念体（Thought-Form）」と呼ばれることもあり、たとえばチベット密教においては「タルパ（Tulpa）」として知られている。
サーヴィターは、広範な任務や機能をあなたの代わりに実行させるために、効果的に運用することができる。

サーヴィターは、特定の状況や出来事に特化して創られることもあれば、たとえば「癒し」といった特定の分野において、より汎用的な用途のために創られることもある。
このような汎用型サーヴィターには、いくつかの利点がある。
第一に、それは「エキスパートシステム」として設計でき、与えられた任務を通じて学習していくものと見なせる。たとえば、癒しの任務を繰り返し与えることで、より効果的なヒーリングを行うようになるかのようである。
第二に、そのサーヴィターを継続的に使用し、実際に効果を体験することによって、使用者の側に「信頼感」が構築されていく。
そして汎用型のサーヴィターであれば、その起動手順（マントラ、シジル、イメージの視覚化シークエンスなど）を知っている者なら誰でも、それを用いて任務を遂行させることができる。

このタイプのサーヴィターの例として、「ICANDOO（アイ・キャン・ドゥー）」という存在がある。
ICANDOOは、サーヴィター創造のための公開グループ・ワークショップにおいて創られた存在で、その名（I-can-do＝「私はできる」）がそのまま召喚のマントラにもなっていた。
その一般的な役割は、使用者が直面するあらゆる障害を乗り越える手助けをすることにあった。

このICANDOOは12人のグループによって創られ、彼ら全員がその日を通して、何らかの問題に対処するためにこのサーヴィターを使用した。
設計の過程では、このサーヴィターがホログラフィックに自らを分割できる能力を持つように設定された。つまり、それぞれの断片がオリジナルと同様の力と能力を保持するように設計されたのである。

さらに抽象度を高めた汎用型として、特定の機能や目的を持たないサーヴィターを創造することも可能である。その役割はただひとつ──自分自身の魔術の成功率を高めるために仕えることである。
このタイプのサーヴィターは、大小問わずさまざまな魔術的行為に使用することができ、とりわけ魅惑（エンチャントメント）・占術・啓示（イリュミネーション）といった実践において有用である。

サーヴィター依存（Servitor Dependency）
一般的には、サーヴィターは使用されるたびに「栄養を得て」強化されていくとされており、成功と見なされる成果が得られれば、その力もまた増していくと考えられている。
したがって、あるサーヴィターが担当する活動領域において何らかの出来事が起きたときには、それをそのサーヴィターの働きによるものとして認識する習慣を身につけることが推奨される。

しかしこの姿勢は、ある種の問題を引き起こすこともある。
たとえば私が1992年に創造したサーヴィター「Eureka（ユリイカ）」──
その活動領域は啓示（illumination）であり、インスピレーション、新しいアイデア、創造性の活性化、そしてブレインストーミング全般に関連づけられていた。

創造当初、このサーヴィターは私の予想を大きく上回る成果をあげた。
私はそれを、執筆、講義、セミナーやワークショップのファシリテーションにおけるアイデア生成の刺激として用いた。
ある同僚との間では、Eurekaは第三の思考（Third Mind）として機能し、会話から立ち上がる創造的跳躍の焦点となっていた。

創造的飛躍が生じるたびに、あるいは思いついたアイデアが実際に使える形になったたびに、Eurekaの力はさらに高まっていった。

ところが1993年、このEurekaの活動は天王星と海王星の合（コンジャンクション）と関連づけられるようになり、その結果──1993年4月22日、両惑星が逆行を始めたその瞬間に、Eurekaはオフラインになってしまった。

この出来事の直接的な結果として、私は創造的思考の流れに入り込むのが急にとても難しくなった。
どうやらEurekaは、私自身の創造的プロセスの中であまりにも支配的な要素となっていたようで、それが取り除かれた途端、適切な精神状態に到達すること自体が困難になってしまったのだ。
私は、そのサーヴィターに依存していたというわけである。

最終的に、私はこのサーヴィターを召還し直し、照明（illumination）に関する断片として再構成されるように分解した。
この経験から教訓を得て以降、私はこの元のサーヴィターの断片を創造性の焦点としてときおり使用する程度にとどめている。

ウイルス的サーヴィター（Viral Servitors）
サーヴィターには、自己を複製・再生産するよう命令を与えることも可能である。
このためのアプローチには以下のようなものがある：

- 細胞分裂のように自己複製するよう指示する

- サイバネティクス的あるいはウイルス的パラメータに従って複製する

- 特定の条件（たとえば時間単位、占星術的トランジット、対象者がある行動をとるたび）に応じて「出産」するサーヴィターを創造する

この概念を初期に試験した例として、以下の事例がある：
あるサーヴィターが、持ち主から差し押さえられていた所有物を取り戻すために派遣された。
設定された期限を過ぎた時点で、このサーヴィターは**混乱の場（confusion field）**を生成し始めた──失くした鍵、電気系統のトラブル、その他の些細ながらイライラさせるような障害である。
さらに第二の期限を過ぎると、サーヴィターは自己複製を開始し、混乱の場は一層強化された。

その後、対象者が差し押さえていた所有物を返還した瞬間、サーヴィターたちは動作を停止した。
このサーヴィターの活動証拠──つまり、些細な問題の累積がポルターガイスト的現象に発展していく様子──は、対象者の関係者たちとの会話を通じて記録された。

このようなウイルス型サーヴィターは、たとえば以下のような長期的エンチャントメントに特に適している：

- 自らの魔術の成功確率を高める

- 治癒目的

- 一般的な防護ワーク
