🇬🇧 Functional Spirits

One approach to Evocation is working with Spirits which have a provenance over a particular situation or experience. Entities such as these are detailed in grimoires such as The Lesser Key of Solomon the King which are handbooks of spirits, giving details of spirits' typical forms, names, sigils, and how to conjure them. The spirits in books such as the Lesser Key have bizarre names, even more bizarre appearances, yet their powers are directly functional and useful. For example, RAUM appears as a blackbird, and can create love, reconcile enemies, or destroy cities and reputations.

The standard approach to summoning these spirits is to use the time-honoured magical ritual, wherein the entities are called forth into a triangle, and ceremonially bound to the magician's will. However, there is also another possibility, which is simply that of summoning a Spirit when you find yourself in an appropriate situation. The following example illustrates this process.
 
All of us, at one time or another, suffer from being stuck in traffic, from freeway jams to slow-moving queues of people. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to whistle up the assistance of a spirit which enabled you to start moving? A big hand please folks for the spirit GOFLOWOLFOG, the spirit who eases traffic blockages so that you can continue your journey. Goflowolfog typically appears in the form of a shades-wearing cat riding a skateboard. He brings with him a wind, and a noise which sounds like 'Neeeowww.' He is of a cool, stylish disposition. 

Gowflowolfog can be summoned when you are in a situation which falls under his governance, such as being stuck in a very crowded train (during a heatwave) which in accordance with the snafu principle, has stopped and shows no sign of moving again. In such a situation, listen out for the 'Neeowww' and watch out for Goflowolfog as he zips past you on his skateboard, leaving the ghost-sensation of a breeze. If nothing else, this act of summoning may take your mind off sources of stress - such as the desire to murder the guy with the boom-box standing next to you as you slowly melt in the heat of the carriage. As the spirit slides past you, attract his attention by transforming yourself (if only inwardly) into a dude who is almost as cool and stylish as Goflowolfog himself, and visualise yourself for a moment standing with him on the skateboard as it flashes through the blockage. Then let go of the 'vision' and relax, allowing the spirit to get on with his job.

If you should summon Goflowolfog to get the traffic around you moving, and he performs his task (even if you only move a few yards), then you are beholden to offer him something in return (it's only good manners). While there are many forms of appeasement to spirits, the two most pleasing to Gowflowolfog are firstly, to allow someone else space to move. This could take the form of stepping back to let someone who is in a hurry walk past you, or allowing another car driver to move into your lane by leaving him a space. Secondly, be kind to the next cat you see. Where does Goflowolfog come from? He was identified and assembled during a magical seminar in London, on an evening when Britain was experiencing a heat-wave, and everyone who had attended the seminar had experienced traffic problems in getting there. The design sequence was as follows:

1. General Situation: Traffic

2. Function - related to situation: Easing Traffic stoppages

3. Naming the Spirit - several suggestions were made for an appropriate name, and GO FLOW was chosen. This name was made suitably 'barbaric' by mirroring it, so becoming GOFLOWOLFOG.

4. Shape of the Spirit - a number of possible shapes were suggested, such as a wheel or set of traffic signals, but the image of a cat riding a skateboard was both memorable, and similar to the bizarre incongruous shapes accorded to spirits in the grimoires.

5. Disposition or Character of the Spirit: it was decided that Goflowolfog could be nothing but cool, stylish and relaxed, speedy and graceful. It was felt that he would respond kindly to anyone who attempted to take on these qualities in a situation as frustrating as being stuck in a traffic jam. The sound associated with the movement of the spirit can also act as a mantra to help call him to you. His sigil, a circle containing two opposite-running arrows, can be used as a talisman, placed on cars, cycles or other modes of transport to draw the favour of Goflowolfog or as a focus for evocation. Using this process, you could easily create your own grimoires of helpful spirits. It can be interesting (and fun!) to do this with a group of friends, so that not only are the spirits 'assembled' by many people, they are also used in different ways. The more successful uses of the spirit that are reported, the more 'confidence' in the spirit will be raised. Given time and wide usage, it may even happen that the image of your spirit enters the general cultural meme-pool. If you ever see a report in the National Enquirer or Fortean Times about sightings of cats riding skateboards, remember Goflowolfog!

🇯🇵 Functional Spirits

召喚の一つのアプローチは、特定の状況や経験に由来する霊と協力することです。このような存在は、『ソロモンの小鍵』のようなグリモワール（霊の手引書）に詳細に記載されており、霊の典型的な形態、名前、印、召喚方法などが記載されています。『ソロモンの小鍵』のような書籍に登場する霊は、奇妙な名前やさらに奇妙な外見を持っていますが、その力は直接的で実用的なものです。例えば、RAUMは黒鳥の姿で現れ、愛を創造したり、敵を和解させたり、都市や評判を破壊したりする能力を持つ。
これらの霊を召喚する標準的な方法は、伝統的な魔術の儀式を用いるもので、霊を三角形の中に呼び出し、魔術師の意志に儀式的に縛り付けるものだ。しかし、もう一つの可能性もある。それは、適切な状況に置かれた際に、単に霊を召喚するということだ。以下の例はこのプロセスを説明している。
私たち全員が、高速道路の渋滞やゆっくり進む人の列など、交通渋滞に巻き込まれる経験がある。もし、移動を再開できるように助けてくれる霊を呼び出せたら便利じゃないだろうか？交通渋滞を解消し、旅を続けられるようにしてくれる霊、GOFLOWOLFOGに拍手を送ろう。Goflowolfogは通常、サングラスをかけた猫がスケートボードに乗った姿で現れる。彼は風と「ニーオオオオ」という音を伴う。クールでスタイリッシュな性格だ。
GOFLOWOLFOGは、彼の管轄下にある状況で召喚できる。例えば、猛暑の日に非常に混雑した電車に閉じ込められ、スナフ原則に従って止まり、再び動く気配がない時などだ。そのような状況では、「ニーオウ」という音を聞き逃さず、スケートボードであなたをすり抜けていくゴウフローウルフに注意せよ。彼は風のような残像を残して去っていく。少なくとも、この召喚行為はストレスの源から気をそらすかもしれない——例えば、熱波の中で溶けそうになりながら、隣で boom-box を鳴らしている男を殺したいという衝動から。霊があなたをすり抜ける際、ゴフローウルフグ自身と同じくらいクールでスタイリッシュな男に（少なくとも心の中で）変身し、彼と共にスケートボードが障害物を突破する瞬間を想像して彼の注意を引き付けよう。その後、その「ビジョン」を手放し、リラックスして霊に仕事を任せてくれ。
もしゴフローウルフを召喚して周囲の交通を動かすことができ、彼が任務を遂行した場合（たとえ数ヤードしか動かなかったとしても）、彼に何かを返す義務がある（それは単なる礼儀だ）。霊をなだめる方法は多くあるが、ゴフローウルフが最も喜ぶのは、まず第一に、他人が動くためのスペースを譲ることだ。例えば、急いでいる人が通り過ぎられるように一歩下がる、または他の車のドライバーが車線に入ってくるスペースを空けることなどだ。第二に、次に会う猫に優しくすること。ゴフローウルフは、どこから来たのか？彼は、イギリスが熱波に見舞われたある夜、ロンドンで開催された魔法のセミナーで、参加者が皆、会場への移動で交通渋滞に巻き込まれた際に、特定され組み立てられた。デザインの流れは以下の通りだ。
1. 一般的な状況：交通
2. 機能（状況に関連）：交通の渋滞を緩和する
3. 霊の名前：適切な名前としていくつかの提案があり、GO FLOWが選ばれた。この名前は、鏡写しにすることで適度に「野蛮」な響きになり、GOFLOWOLFOGとなった。
4. 精神の形状：車輪や交通信号機などの複数の形状が提案されたが、スケートボードに乗った猫のイメージが記憶に残り、グリモワールに描かれる奇妙な不釣り合いな形状と類似していたため採用された。
5. 霊の性格や特徴：Goflowolfogはクールでスタイリッシュ、リラックスした性格で、速く優雅であるべきだと決定された。彼は、交通渋滞のようなイライラする状況で、これらの特徴を真似ようとする人に対して親切に応えるだろうと考えられた。霊の動きに関連する音は、彼を呼び寄せるためのマントラとしても機能する。彼のシンボルである、反対方向に走る2本の矢を含む円は、タリスマンとして使用でき、車や自転車、その他の交通手段に配置することでゴフローウルフオグの恩恵を引き寄せたり、召喚の焦点として使用できる。このプロセスを使用すれば、自分だけの役立つ精霊のグリモワールを簡単に作成できる。友人グループでこれを行うと、精霊が多くの人の手で「集められる」だけでなく、異なる方法で使用されるため、興味深く（そして楽しい！）体験になる。精霊の成功事例が報告されるほど、その精霊への「信頼」が高まる。時間と広範な使用を経て、あなたの霊のイメージが一般的な文化のミームプールに入る可能性もある。もし『ナショナル・エンクワイアラー』や『フォートゥアン・タイムズ』でスケートボードに乗る猫の目撃報告を見かけたら、ゴフローウルフを思い出してくれ！
