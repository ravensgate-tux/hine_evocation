üá¨üáß Functional Spirits

One approach to Evocation is working with Spirits which have a provenance over a particular situation or experience. Entities such as these are detailed in grimoires such as The Lesser Key of Solomon the King which are handbooks of spirits, giving details of spirits' typical forms, names, sigils, and how to conjure them. The spirits in books such as the Lesser Key have bizarre names, even more bizarre appearances, yet their powers are directly functional and useful. For example, RAUM appears as a blackbird, and can create love, reconcile enemies, or destroy cities and reputations.

The standard approach to summoning these spirits is to use the time-honoured magical ritual, wherein the entities are called forth into a triangle, and ceremonially bound to the magician's will. However, there is also another possibility, which is simply that of summoning a Spirit when you find yourself in an appropriate situation. The following example illustrates this process.
 
All of us, at one time or another, suffer from being stuck in traffic, from freeway jams to slow-moving queues of people. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to whistle up the assistance of a spirit which enabled you to start moving? A big hand please folks for the spirit GOFLOWOLFOG, the spirit who eases traffic blockages so that you can continue your journey. Goflowolfog typically appears in the form of a shades-wearing cat riding a skateboard. He brings with him a wind, and a noise which sounds like 'Neeeowww.' He is of a cool, stylish disposition. 

Gowflowolfog can be summoned when you are in a situation which falls under his governance, such as being stuck in a very crowded train (during a heatwave) which in accordance with the snafu principle, has stopped and shows no sign of moving again. In such a situation, listen out for the 'Neeowww' and watch out for Goflowolfog as he zips past you on his skateboard, leaving the ghost-sensation of a breeze. If nothing else, this act of summoning may take your mind off sources of stress - such as the desire to murder the guy with the boom-box standing next to you as you slowly melt in the heat of the carriage. As the spirit slides past you, attract his attention by transforming yourself (if only inwardly) into a dude who is almost as cool and stylish as Goflowolfog himself, and visualise yourself for a moment standing with him on the skateboard as it flashes through the blockage. Then let go of the 'vision' and relax, allowing the spirit to get on with his job.

If you should summon Goflowolfog to get the traffic around you moving, and he performs his task (even if you only move a few yards), then you are beholden to offer him something in return (it's only good manners). While there are many forms of appeasement to spirits, the two most pleasing to Gowflowolfog are firstly, to allow someone else space to move. This could take the form of stepping back to let someone who is in a hurry walk past you, or allowing another car driver to move into your lane by leaving him a space. Secondly, be kind to the next cat you see. Where does Goflowolfog come from? He was identified and assembled during a magical seminar in London, on an evening when Britain was experiencing a heat-wave, and everyone who had attended the seminar had experienced traffic problems in getting there. The design sequence was as follows:

1. General Situation: Traffic

2. Function - related to situation: Easing Traffic stoppages

3. Naming the Spirit - several suggestions were made for an appropriate name, and GO FLOW was chosen. This name was made suitably 'barbaric' by mirroring it, so becoming GOFLOWOLFOG.

4. Shape of the Spirit - a number of possible shapes were suggested, such as a wheel or set of traffic signals, but the image of a cat riding a skateboard was both memorable, and similar to the bizarre incongruous shapes accorded to spirits in the grimoires.

5. Disposition or Character of the Spirit: it was decided that Goflowolfog could be nothing but cool, stylish and relaxed, speedy and graceful. It was felt that he would respond kindly to anyone who attempted to take on these qualities in a situation as frustrating as being stuck in a traffic jam. The sound associated with the movement of the spirit can also act as a mantra to help call him to you. His sigil, a circle containing two opposite-running arrows, can be used as a talisman, placed on cars, cycles or other modes of transport to draw the favour of Goflowolfog or as a focus for evocation. Using this process, you could easily create your own grimoires of helpful spirits. It can be interesting (and fun!) to do this with a group of friends, so that not only are the spirits 'assembled' by many people, they are also used in different ways. The more successful uses of the spirit that are reported, the more 'confidence' in the spirit will be raised. Given time and wide usage, it may even happen that the image of your spirit enters the general cultural meme-pool. If you ever see a report in the National Enquirer or Fortean Times about sightings of cats riding skateboards, remember Goflowolfog!
