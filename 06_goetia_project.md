🇬🇧 Some Observations from The Goetia Project

The Goetia Project was the title of as long-term project undertaken by myself and a colleague in 1989. Our original aim was to work through a series of 'traditional' grimoires and, following assessments and analysis of our findings, create a general approach to Goetia suitable for our post-modern era. Needless to say, things did not go exactly as we planned.

Our first series of workings was drawn from the Lesser Key of Solomon. Our first evocation, of the spirit Vassago, was performed without using the traditional arrangement of circle, triangle, etc. Just to see what happened, as it were. The result was that the working lacked clear definition; visions of the spirit called forth were hazy at best, and we both experienced a lowering of vitality (a feeling of being 'drained'), headaches and pre-flulike symptoms for a couple of days following. In view of this, we constructed a permanent circle and triangle, according to the 'rules' in the lesser Key, and all workings were conducted in the fashion outlined in the lesser Key.

Using the long conjurations and constraints to the spirit given punctuated by the Old Testament names of God and Biblical quotations, quickly raises excitement to a fever pitch, and once the spirit can be discerned, it must then be abjured to remain within the Triangle of Art. The shapes which the spirits assumed were rarely exactly that described within the lesser Key (hereafter LK), but generally similar. We found that once a spirit had appeared to us in a particular form, then it more or less took that shape in subsequent evocations.

Once evoked, a spirit would then be questioned bout its nature, qualities, and how we could improve upon the evocationenvironment. In one instance, we uestioned the spirit Vassago about the optimum time for evoking him. He made reply by showing us a sundial, hourglass and skull. We further tested him by requiring him to give me a vision of where my colleague would be the following afternoon. I was promptly given a clear vision of walking through long corridors filled with people and lined with lockers, of going up a flight of stairs and walking into a room, which was full of boxes - but at this point, the vision became unclear. My colleague later told me that the building I had 'seen' was Leeds Polytechnic, and that the room with 'boxes' (where the vision had become unclear) was he computer department! This led us to feel that computers were outside the experience of Vassago, as were digital watches.

Whilst working through the series of evocations we also attempted various modifications to the conjurations. Invocation of appropriate God-forms, such as orus, prior to beginning the evocatory process, seemed to make the conjuration of spirits such as Haures or Andromelius easier. During an evocation of Glasyglabolas, we preceded the conjurations with an invocation of chaos, The Unsealing of the Vortices, which was originally designed for a series of Eris workings. As we did this, a windstorm blew up about the house we were working in, but the spirit we were attempting to conjure flickered in and out ofthe triangle. It seemed to us that the 'energies' created by the Vortices was impeding the spirit's ability to manifest, so we closed them, the windstorm dropped away, and the spirit came through into the triangle.

Incidents such as these led us to postulate that the LK spirits tended to a certain degree of conservatism over the parameters within which they could he cal led forth. The visions that they imparted to us concerning the optimum environment for conjuration definitely belonged to the 'baroque' school of magic - cellars, clouds of incense, lots of paraphernalia etc.

🇯🇵 Some Observations from The Goetia Project

「ゴエティア・プロジェクト」は、1989年に私と同僚が着手した長期プロジェクトのタイトルです。当初の目的は、一連の「伝統的な」グリモアを研究し、その評価と分析に基づいて、ポストモダン時代に適したゴエティアの一般的なアプローチを確立することでした。言うまでもなく、計画通りには進みませんでした。
最初の作業シリーズは『ソロモンの小鍵』から引用した。最初の召喚は、ヴァサゴの霊を、伝統的な円や三角形などの配置を使用せずに実施した。ただ「何が起こるか見てみよう」という感じだった。その結果、作業は明確な定義に欠け、召喚された精霊のビジョンは曖昧で、私たちは数日間、活力の低下（'消耗したような感覚）、頭痛、インフルエンザのような症状を経験した。このため、私たちは『小鍵』の'ルール
に従って永久的な円と三角形を構築し、すべての作業を『小鍵』に記された方法に従って実施した。
旧約聖書の神の御名と聖書の引用で区切られた長い召喚文と霊への制約を使用すると、興奮が急速に高まり、霊が識別できるようになったら、三角形のアート内に留まるよう退去させなければならない。霊が取った形は、小鍵（以下LK）に記述されたものと正確に一致することはほとんどなかったが、一般的には類似していた。私たちは、霊が特定の形態で現れた場合、その後の召喚でもほぼ同じ形態を取ることを発見した。
召喚された霊は、その性質、特性、および召喚環境を改善する方法について質問された。ある事例では、私たちは霊ヴァサゴに、彼を召喚する最適な時間について質問した。彼は日時計、砂時計、そして頭蓋骨を示すことで回答した。さらに、同僚が翌日の午後どこにいるかをビジョンで示すよう要求してテストした。私はすぐに、人でごった返す長い廊下を歩き、ロッカーが並ぶ廊下を通り抜け、階段を上がり、箱で埋め尽くされた部屋に入るという明確なビジョンを受けた。しかし、この時点でビジョンは不明瞭になった。同僚は後で、私が見た建物がリーズ・ポリテクニックであり、箱で埋め尽くされた部屋（ビジョンが不明瞭になった場所）がコンピュータ部門だったと教えてくれた。これにより、ヴァサゴの経験の範囲外にコンピュータやデジタル時計が含まれないことが分かった。
召喚のシリーズを進める中で、私たちは召喚の儀式に様々な変更を加えてみた。召喚プロセスを開始する前に、オラスなどの適切な神々の形態を召喚することは、ハレスやアンドロメリウスのような霊を召喚するのを容易にするようだった。グラスィグラボラスを召喚する際、私たちは召喚の前に、エリスの作業シリーズのために設計された「渦の封印解除」という混沌の召喚を行った。この際、作業中の家周辺に突風が発生したが、召喚しようとしていた霊は三角形の中を消え入りそうになりながら現れた。私たちは、渦によって生成された「エネルギー」が霊の顕現を妨げていると考え、渦を閉じると突風は収まり、霊は三角形の中へ現れた。
このような出来事は、LKの霊が召喚される際のパラメーターに対して一定の保守性を示す傾向があるという仮説を導いた。彼らが私たちに伝えた召喚の最適な環境に関するビジョンは、間違いなく「バロック」派の魔術に属するものだった——地下室、香の煙、多くの装飾品など。
