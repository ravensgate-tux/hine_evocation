🇬🇧 Servitors 

A Servitor is an entity consciously created or generated, using evocatory techniques, to perform a task or service. In the Western Esoteric Tradition, such entities are sometimes referred to as 'Thought-Forms', whilst in Tibetan magic, for example, they are known as 'Tulpas'. Servitors can be usefully deployed perform a wide range of tasks or functions on your behalf. Servitors can be created to work with one particular situation or event or, alternatively, Servitors can be created which have a general provenance in one area, such as healing. There are a number of advantages to using more generalised Servitors. Firstly, they can be regarded as expert systems which learn from being given a task to execute - as if the more healing tasks you give a servitor, the better it seems to become at healing. Secondly,continued use of the Servitor, with successful results, builds up 'confidence' in it's activity on the part of those who use it. With a more generalised Servitor, anyone who knows its activation sequence (such as a mantra, sigil, or visualisation sequence) can employ it to work at a given task. One example of this form of Servitor is the entity ICANDOO. ICANDOO (I-can-do) was created at an open group workshop in Servitor creation. The name of the Servitor was also its mantra for summoning it, and it's general brief was to assist those who used it for overcoming any obstacles that crossed them. ICANDOO was created by a group of 12 people, and all of them used the Servitor throughout the day, to assist them with problems of one sort or another. In the design sequence, the Servitor was given the ability to divide itself holographically, so that each segment contained the powers and abilities of the original entity.

On a still further level of generalisation, you can create Servitors who have no specific function or provenance, saving that they serve to increase the success of one's own magics. Such servitors can be used in both major and minor acts of magic, and are particularly useful in acts of enchantment, divination, or illumination. Servitor Dependency It is generally held that each usage of a Servitor serves to feed it, and that each result which is rated as a success, serves to enhance it's power. It is also a good idea to get into the habit of attributing any occurrences within the sphere of activity of that Servitor, to it's work. This can lead to problems, though. In 1992 I created a Servitor called Eureka. It's given sphere of activity was that of Illumination - inspiration, new ideas, the boosting of creativity and brainstorming in general. Initially, the Servitor exceeded all my expectations of it's performance. I used it to stimulate new ideas for writing, lecturing and facilitating seminars & workshops. With a colleague, it became a focus for brainstorming - acting as a Third Mind arising from conversation. Each time we made a creative leap, or an idea formed became something workable in practice, the power of the Servitor was boosted. In 1993, the activity of Eureka was linked with the Neptune-Uranus conjunction with the result that, on April 22nd, as Neptune & Uranus began to retrograde, Eureka went offline.

The immediate result of this was that I suddenly found it much harder to get into a flow of creative thinking. It seemed that Eureka had become such a dominant element in the dynamics of my own creative process that, once it was removed, I found it much harder to get into the appropriate frame of mind. I had become dependent upon the Servitor. Eventually, the Servitor was recalled and disassembled in such a way that a illumination. Having been made wiser by this experience, I only occasionally use this fragment of the original servitor as a focus for creativity. Viral Servitors It is possible to instruct Servitors to replicate or reproduce themselves. Approaches to this include instructing the Servitor to replicate itself as a form of cell-division, replication which follows cybernetic or viral parameters, or to create a servitor which gives birth according to particular parameters, such as time-units, astrological transits, or each time the target of the Servitor carries out a particular behaviour. An early test of this concept was that of a Servitor despatched to assist in the recovery of property being withheld from it's owner. Once a set deadline had been passed, the Servitor began to generate a field of confusion - lost keys, electrical blowouts & other minor but annoying problems. After a second set deadline, the Servitor began to replicate itself, so that the confusion field generated was intensified. As soon as the recipient of the Servitor returned the property he had been withholding from it's owner, the Servitors ceased to function. Evidence of the Servitors action - the intensification of minor problems escalating into strange poltergeist-type phenomenon, was gathered by talking to associates of the target. Viral Servitors are particularly appropriate for long-term enchantments, such as increasing the probability of one's magic being successful, or being used in healing & general protection workings.

SERVITOR DESIGN SEQUENCE

1. Define General Intent

The first step in designing a Servitor is to decide the general sphere of influence into which your intention falls, such as healing, protection, binding, harmony, luck, divination, mood enhancement, success in ...., and so forth. Defining your general intent will assist you if you wish to use symbols & magical correspondences in creating your servitor. For example, if you were interested in creating a servitor to act within the sphere of Healing, then you could assemble any associations, symbols, emotions, memories, etc which you relate to the concept of Healing. By consulting a book of magical correspondences such as '777', you could build up chains of correspondences - planetary figures, scents, colours, planetary hours etc. How far you go in this direction is very much a matter of personal choice.

2. Defining Specific Intent

Here, you are creating the core of the Servitor's purpose the Statement of Intent which is analogous to the Servitor's aetheric DNA. Formulating the Servitor's Statement of Intent may necessitate a good deal of self-analysis into your motivations, desires, realistic projections of goals, etc. As in all sorcery operations, it is appropriate to ask advice from your preferred form of divination. To continue the example of a Healing Servitor, an appropriate Statement of Intent might be:
To promote rapid recovery and health in ...(name)... Once you have determined the appropriate Intent to form the basis of your Servitor, then the Statement can be rendered into a sigil, or glyph..

3. What Symbols Are Appropriate to the Servitor's Task?

There is a wealth of magical & mythic symbols which you can draw upon when creating a servitor, which can be used to represent different qualities, abilities and attributes. There is lso the symbolism of colour, smell, sound & other sensory media to draw upon. In order to refine the program which forms the basis for your servitor further, you could embellish the sigil by adding other symbols.

4. Is there a Time Factor to Consider?

Here, you should consider the duration of the Servitor's operation. In other words, do you want the Servitor to be working continuously, or only at specific periods? Here, you may wish to take into account phases of the moon, astrological conjunctions or planetary hours, for example, which could be added into the Servitor's symbolic instructions. The Healing Servitor above for example, was instructed to be active for a period of seven days, affecting it's target recipient for seven minutes, at seven hour intervals. This instruction serves to reinforce the number symbolism & association with harmony. It is also at this point that you should consider what happens after the Servitor has performed its task. It is generally held to be preferable that when a Servitor has completed its task, the Servitor should be disassembled by its creator. There are two approaches to doing this. Firstly, one can encode a self-destruct instruction into the Servitor at the time of it's creation, where the duration of its existence is defined in terms of the duration of its task, or the fulfilment of a specific condition. The other approach to disassembly is to perform a ritual reabsorption of the Servitor, mentally drawing it back from it's task, taking it apart by visualization, taking back the original desire which sparked it's creation, and taking apart or destroying any material base which you have created for it. Whilst classical occult theory has it that if you do not look after your thoughtforms,they will wander around the astral plane annoying people, there is good psychological sense for terminating the life of Servitors which have completed their assigned task - that you are reclaiming responsibility for that desire-complex which you used to create the Servitor.

5. Is A Name Required?

The Servitor can be given a name which can be used, in addition to its sigil, for creating, powering, or controlling it. A name also acts to further create a ervitor's persona. A name can reflect the Servitor's task, or be formed from a mantric sigil of it's Statement of Intent.

6. Is a Material Base Required?

The Material base is some physical focus for the Servitor's existence. This can help to define the Servitor as an individual entity, and can be used if you need to recall the Servitor for any reason. Examples of a material base include bottles, rings, crystals, small figurines as used in fantasy role-playing or figures crafted from modelling compounds. Bodily fluids can be applied to the material base to increase the perceived link between creator and entity. This is very much a matter of personal taste. Alternatively, the Servitor can remain freely mobile as an aetheric entity. I tend to find that one-shot, task-specific servitors can be left as aetheric entities, whilst for entities which have more of along-term use, a material base is often helpful. For others, it might be possible to link their use to a specific, identifiable, state of consciousness, which forms part of the core associations which one builds up for a Servitor. It is also possible to link a Servitor to a specific smell, such as a perfume or essential oil, so that each time the oil is applied, the Servitor is activated. This can be particularly useful when creating Servitors for general Healing, Protection, or enhancement of a particular mood. A dab of the perfume can be put onto the Servitor's material base, and the perfume should be inhaled during the launch of the entity.

7. Is a Specific Shape Required?

Servitors can be created to have any desired shape, from tiny homunculi to morphic spheres capable of extruding any required appendage. The shape you choose to  dentify with this particular thought-form can add another level of representational identity to the entity. A common practice though, is to visualize the Servitor as a featureless sphere, pulsing with energy, glowing with appropriately chosen colours, into which has been impressed, it's sigilised instructions.
