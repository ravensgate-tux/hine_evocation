🇬🇧 Evoking Yog-Sothoth

Introduction

One of the aims of the Esoteric Order of Dagon is to develop effective magical techniques with which to interact with the Great Old Ones. As a member of the Pylon of Yog-Sothoth Lodge, I have become increasingly interested in the possibility of ritually evoking this entity as a tangible phenomena. The aim of this article is to expound a possible methodology by which entities such as Yog-Sothoth can be contacted, drawing together research in different fields of enquiry, and exploring how they relate to the Cthulhu Mythos. I feel that, rather than exploring Lovecraftian themes using traditional magical systems such as the Qabalah (though obviously, it may provide a useful parallel), the most obvious place to look for guidelines is Lovecraft's fiction itself. From this, we find that for example, in The Dunwich Horror, Lovecraft clearly illustrates that 'hilltop' rites, associated with stone circles and strange geophysical phenomena, are a key when approaching entities such as Yog-Sothoth. Bringing the Great Old Ones into our dimension requires some form of 'gate', which in mythos tales, is often a wild outdoor site, a stone circle, tower, or a similar type of power spot. Lovecraft is also careful to point out that such sites have, in historical terms, a long history of strange manifestations associated with them. Again and again, he places great emphasis on the folklore of those who live on the borders of such areas; that 'locals' have traditions that the educated sceptics appearing in the tales scoff at.

The theme of specific regions which have a long history of strange manifestations is well-documented. John Keel, in Strange Creatures From Time & Space, explores several cases involving the manifestation of strange beings that appear to be localised to a particular region. One example of this is the Moth-man sightings in West Virginia, which occurred between 1966-1968. Another area, perhaps of more interest to UK EOD initiates is Ilkley Moor, which has a long, and well-documented history of strange phenomena encountered, from ghosts and black dogs to UFOs and what modern researchers in the field of Earth Mysteries call Earth Lights.

The Earth Lights phenomena has arisen largely from the work of Paul Deveraux, editor of The Ley Hunter and co-founder of The Dragon Project. His theories are drawn from the fact that the Earth produces a range of light-forms by natural processes. These 'unexplained' light-forms have been interpreted by those who encounter them as UFOs or spectral manifestations. The occurrence of these phenomena is commonly found to be specific to a particular region. The lights often 'follow' cars, or are reported by observers to behave as though they were being guided or were intelligent. Deveraux notes that outbreaks of EL phenomena are sometimes associated with columns of gaseous material, which can be interpreted by observers as 'white lady' type ghosts. Researchers in the field of Earth Mysteries hypothesise that the source of such light-forms is the tectonic activity of the Earth, where stress along fault lines combines with other factors to emit light phenomena in the area around the fault line. Deveraux notes that medieval tin and copper miners actually looked for the appearance of lights from the ground when searching out new mine sites. A UFO 'flap' around Ilkley Moor in 1984 appears to validate this theory, as it followed an exceptional earthquake in that area, which measured at 5.5 on the Richter Scale. Some accounts of observers of light forms (commonly perceived as UFOs) suggested that the manifestations followed the patterns of the fault lines that run under the region. Deveraux's book, Earth Lights Revelation, explores this kind of activity all over the world, and notes the strong connection between UFO sightings and geological faulting. While many Ufologists reject the Earth Lights theory which in part explains UFO encounters as a purely terrestrial phenomena, Earth Mysteries research is continuing to document evidence to support and further edify Deveraux's ideas.

Reading accounts of Earth Light sightings and their relationship to specific regions and underground activity is for me, very reminiscent of Lovecraft's accounts of the activities associated with the Great Old Ones. What is perhaps also significant for the modern magician is that very often, stone circles and other sacred sites are situated in regions where geological faulting takes place. Deveraux proposes that the sites perhaps served to amplify and focus the natural occurrence of light phenomena. There is a wealth of folklore worldwide which could be related to the appearance of Earth Lights, from Will o the Wisps to Faeries, Ghosts, and more recently, UFOs. 

From Butterflies to Beezlebub

I am greatly indebted to the recent explorations by Fra. Choronzon of the Illuminates of Thanateros for his lucid exposition of Chaos Mathematics, especially in its relation to magical entities. In an essay entitled Chaos Invocation, Fra. Choronzon writes that: 

We are all aware that information can be transferred from one place to another by modulation of electro-magnetic standing waves. I would like you to consider the possibility that information might also be capable of storage or transfer within a toroidal (i.e. doughnut-shaped) structure having an electromagnetic character. 

Choronzon goes on to suggest that such ordered structures arise quite naturally out of the Chaos Mathematics which governs the behaviour of gases and liquids. Probably the bestknown example of this is the great Red Spot which appears in Jupiters atmosphere. He gives the example of a blown smokering being such a structure, and goes onto point out that it is conceivable that a non-smoker could equally well project a ring of gas from their lips, which could be established in the atmosphere, though its presence, by normal standards, would be impossible to detect. Choronzon proposes that it is mathematically possible for such structures, which have (at least in part) an electromagnetic character to exist within the Earths magnetic field. He also proposes that it is possible to produce such structures by expending energy in the form of neurochemical activity in the nervous system. In short, physiological gnoses of the sort used by magicians in ritual can produce such toroid structures.

The above has interesting implications for both magicians and researchers into Earth Mysteries. Over the past year, I have been conducting a great deal of research into the creation, usage, and aetiology of evoked entities, including both the demonic forms of the Goetia and the Elemental Servitorscreated by magicians to perform a specific task. In the latter case, the process is very much one of creating an information matrix; that is, of laying down a set of instructions which define the nature, abilities, and functions of the entity. Into this information matrix is projected energy, which forms the entity as a whole, which is then able to act, independently of its creator. A purely psychological or subjective account of this process cannot account for the ability of such an entity to manifest results (in accordance with the creator's intent) in the physical world.

Following Choronzons ideas on Chaos Dynamics, it seems likely to me that in evoking, and thereby creating, an elemental servitor, one could be bringing into existence a structure such as is outlined above. If we can accept (at least in theory) that these structures are capable of retaining information over time, then we could be looking at a partial model for a wide range of phenomena associated with discrete spirits. In my experience (and that of colleagues), the more work that is given to an elemental servitor, the more powerful it becomes - in terms of its ability to manipulate probabilities, and eventually take on an independent character of its own. It is not unknown for powerful entities to survive the death of their creator. The more people that create such an entity also enhances its survival and capacity to store information. In these terms, it is easy to see how a small spirit may, given time and the energy input (directed through ritual and other techniques for directing energy) by enough people, could become what we commonly assume to be gods.

To side-step for a moment, I wish to look again at some of the phenomena associated with UFO and spectral encounters. One factor that rises time and again to haunt the sceptical researcher is the commonality of experiences between different individuals who come into contact with these anomalies. Historical research into UFO flaps shows that there have been spates of sightings of mysterious spirits, dirigibles, aircraft, submarines, and of course, flying saucers, throughout history. Also, numerous reports from individuals who have been contacted by extra- terrestrial entities show similar structural features in the accounts which have been remembered (often by hypnosis being used as a recall technique). In dealing withsuch phenomena, there is obviously a great many factors which need to be taken into consideration, but I would like to discuss some of the possible processes which are occurring, with the aim of weaving them into the discussion later.

Perhaps I should begin by making a declaration; that I do not believe that consciousness is a purely internal or subjective experience; rather, it is an emergent property of our interaction with the biosphere as a whole. I would assert that consciousness, and the self-referential awareness of human beings, are not necessarily one and the same. When individuals encounter something outside their embedded structure of how the world should be - that is, consensus reality, it seems to me that there is a factor which can be termed the credibility envelope which comes into play, whereby an individual fits the experience into a category that least strains the limitations of consensus reality. Thus a strange encounter may become a meeting with a religious entity, a ghost, or creatures from outer space. Conscious belief  in the validity of such entities is not necessarily a factor, since all these phenomena are part of the folklore of the unknown and can be present as memes (units of information) in the subconscious mind of the individual, thanks to our information-rich culture, with its vast networks of media for the transmission of information. Investigation into such experiences suggests that people, given some form of unusual stimulus, such a strange light, will elaborate all kinds of information. Recall techniques such as hypnosis are fallible in that the psychological tendency to confabulate information (an unconscious defence mechanism) tends to yield up a great deal of information which investigators re expecting to hear, which can again be drawn from information stored in the unconscious about what is commonly associated with this type of experience. Another example of this process is the reports of so-called survivors of satanic child abuse which is rich in detail about bizarre practices but very hazy when it comes to names, dates, places and so forth. The common themes which arise in such encounters could well be a product of cultural similarities between individuals, or even commonalities formed from the way the human brain structures perception. 

Paul Deveraux tentatively asserts the proposition that the Earth Light phenomena is consciousness-sensitive. That is, that the energy forms are sensitive to the conscious mind of the observer. Many accounts of Earth Lights talk about the lights following the observer, playing tag with them, or appear to display the characteristics of being intelligently guided. This brings us back to magical phenomena and Fra. Choronzons Chaos Invocation theories. When creating (or evoking a spirit from a grimoire), we are focusing energy and building an information matrix which, in turn, allows the energy to create a discrete entity
which behaves within the limits of the information given - either the information which defines the characteristics of the entity, or the information given in the grimoire. This process is similar (though far more intentional and directed) to the interaction between a strange phenomena - an Earth Light for example, - and the individual who encounters it. Traditional theories concerning the interaction between human beings and spirits time and time again recount the idea that spirits like interacting with humans because we confer on them a property of individuality that they do not inherently possess. I feel that there is a grain of truth in this view; that our capacity to organise and structure information into discrete wholes is a key feature in coming to grips with this kind of experience. All magical psychocosms, such as Qabalah, Abra-Melin, etc., give a series of instructions as to how entities summoned using those structures behave.

Bearing in mind Fra. Choronzons ideas concerning the toroidal structures which are at least partially electro-magnetic in character, I would say that it is not beyond the bounds of possibility for such a phenomena to be related to occurrences such as Earth Light encounters. If such an energy form responds to (or stimulates) the human capacity to create an information matrix, or indeed if our interaction with the energy form produces as an emergent property a gestalt in accordance with either a deliberately projected or an unconsciously formed idea of what the phenomena is, then we are close to arriving at a
working methodology for accounting for a wide range of occurrences. Drawing on Fra. Choronzons work further, if we can accept that the energy form, once given a structural definition by an initial encounter with an individual or group of individuals, can retain that definition over time, then it becomes possible to see how people can, during an encounter flap in a given region, report seeing similar manifestations. In short, the energy form, once given a structure, can retain this information, and feed them back to other individuals who subsequently interact with them.

The Neuromancer Effect

A parallel phenomena which fits this hypothesis is that of Channelling. In an essay entitled Morons From Inner Space?: A Critical Look at Channelled Communications I set out a model of one of the processes possibly involved in the channelling experience:
 
One of the major characters is an Artificial Intelligence which manipulates a cast of humans to further its own ends. To successfully do this it must establish a rapport with those it wishes to manipulate. It does this by generating constructs - personalities which it wears like masks, creating them out of the memories of the humans it wishes to contact. It explains that it needs these masks to establish a point of access - an interface - between its own experience and the perceptual limits of human beings. Reading this brought very much to mind accounts of human- entity contacts. Particularly a sentence in Dion Fortunes The Cosmic Doctrine, which reads:

What we are you cannot realise and it is a waste of time to try and do so but you can imagine (italics mine) us on the astral plane and we can contact you through your imagination, and though your mental picture is not real or actual, the results of it are real and actual.

Dion Fortune made extensive use of inner-plane contacts to synthesise her magical ideas. Alan Richardson, in his biography of Dion Fortune, Priestess, discusses the various historical figures that Fortune claimed to be in contact with. The most interesting entity is one David Carsons, whom according to Fortune, was a young British officer who was killed during the first World War. Fortune provided a good deal of biographical information concerning Carsons, and after thorough research, Alan Richardson states that Carsons did not exist! Rather, it seems, he was actually, in terms of the above model, a construct; a personality generated out of Dion Fortunes experimental magic and experiences, and hence an interface for accessing information. If you imagine the  sum total of your personal memories and knowledge as a sphere in space - the unknown - then to extend your sphere of information it is as though a window must be created, through which the unknown, or raw data, can be translated into information that is meaningful in terms of perceptual limitations. Inner-plane entities are how we tend to conceptualise these windows into chaos. They appear as independent entities so that we can make sense of the incoming data. Their personalities are usually concurrent with the recipients belief system. Hence the many forms of the entities, depending on where you believe the seat of wisdom is, be it Egypt, Sirius B, or some draughty monastery in Tibet. Usually, it seems, these entities are automatically generated as one focuses will and imagination towards any one vector, but occasionally entities can be generated as an act of will, so that outposts can be established within which personal ideas and inner-worlds can be explored and eventually integrated into ones psychocosm. At this point the whole issue of the reality of the experience breaks down, as these entities are not simply secondary personalities in the pathological sense, but constructs which are emergent properties of our information-processing capacity interacting with that which lies beyond it.

It strikes me that the above model is also valid for a wide range of magical phenomena connected with spirit contacts - that the human tendency to relate to all things as though they are discrete phenomena ( surely a property of how our brains organise information ) enables us to generate masks or personae upon the energy forms we are encountering. Channelled communications from entities are often a by-product of UFO experiences as well as psychic encounters. It may well be that our interaction with energy forms gives rise to such constructs - that masks are created and retained by the energy structures, not from any kind of self-referential intelligence on the part of the Earth Lights, but from the principle (from Systems Theory) that some energy forms are attracted towards structures of higher cohesiveness, such as the information field generated by the human brain, or possibly the electro-magnetic field generated by cars, power lines, etc.

All of which leads us slowly back to Stone Circles; Lovecraftsfrienzied rites on the hilltops, and the role that sound plays in all of this. There is a great deal of magical literature available exploring the dynamics of sound, particularly different vocal techniques used to produce an Altered State of Consciousness(ASC). One of the key factors seems to be rhythm. rhythms carry our consciousness along, from heartbeats, to cycles of breathing, sleeping, night-day and the passage of seasons. rhythms promote associated body movements and adjustments, and act as a signal to begin movement without conscious effort, 

so that less energy is expended when you begin; for example, it has been shown that soldiers can march further, and in better form, with less fatigue, when accompanied by a marching band. The feeling of being carried comes from the structure that rhythm gives to our time-sense, and the pattern gives a sense of continuance. It becomes a motor attitude, and ones attention is freed (if this is desired). rhythms also become mirrored by our brain activity, and they have powerful physiological effects on us. Music Therapists have found that people suffering from Aphasia or Huntingdons Chorea (both neurological disorders which impair speech) can carry a tune, and group singing is a common element in therapeutic voice training. Anthropologists have done a great deal of work examining the role that music plays in hallucinogenic journeys. The presence of music as a ritual accessory to hallucinogenic drug use can be observed on a wide cross-cultural base. Marlene Dobkin De Rios, in her book Hallucinogens: A Cross-Cultural Perspective, suggests that the ritualised use of music within  allucinogenic journeys helps the shaman leading such an experience to provide a structure with which to point participants towards significant experiences within the trip. This is also seen in Voudoun, where specific drumming rituals announce the manifestation of particular Lao. What is obvious from this is that sound imposes a structure onto experience, in particular, with regard to Time-sense. Of which, more later.

Returning to Fra. Chorozons work on Chaos Invocation, he notes the use of a pulse of sound injected into the space occupied by one of the toroidal structures he describes by which the information matrix is transferred to the structure. The forceful enunciation of sound, whether it be Enochian Calls, Primal Speech, or Barbarous Words of Evocation of necessity produces an ASC, as techniques such as these lead to hyperventilation, increased brain activity, tachycardia, etc. It is well-accepted by magicians and mystics that sound carries thought and that for advanced practitioners, vocalisation is not a necessity for the ritual (or whatever) to be efficacious. What is important, is the focusing of awareness along a particular vector, and the entry into an ASC where the practitioner can focus attention intensely towards a single point and project it forth.

The relationship between sound and sacred sites is also being researched, again by Paul Deveraux. The hill noises of The Dunwich Horror have been reported occasionally as emanating from the locality of sacred sites, differing in variety between high- pitched buzzing, humming noises, and thunderclapsbeneath the Earth. In Places of Power, Deveraux notes the suggestion that ultrasound is possibly emitted at some megalith sites, although more work needs to be done to corroborate this elusive finding. Of more interest is what Deveraux calls The Physics of Shamanism. Here, he expounds the relationship between psychic (or psi) experiences and the electro-magnetic and radiation anomalies associated with sacred sites. Deveraux states that for him, one of the characteristics of of a psychic experience related to radiation anomalies is that of the sense of time-slip, where an individual is dislocated in space-time and experiences a vision of past (or future) time. Now altered time perceptions are a common feature of magical ritual, hallucinogenic use, UFO encounters and spectral manifestations. This leads me to suggest that Time is not merely as we usually perceive it - a separate force acting upon us, but itself is a product of consciousness. In states of gnosis, however they are brought on, experiencing the sense that time has stopped, or that future, past, and present can be apprehended simultaneously, is fairly common. It is also a common feature of Type 4 Close Encounters, where people claim to have been taken on board alien spacecraft and subjected to tests (or other indignities), and also of possession states from which an individual may emerge with only a fragmentary memory of
what took place. From a magical point of view, this peak in an ASC is the most fortuitous moment at which to project energy forth to realise ones will. Following the theory of Earth Lights, together with Fra. Choronzons toroidal structures that assume their own information structure, it may well be that such phenomena bring about timeslip experiences and, as to the source of the images that come in, well we could speculate far and wide. That we may be much more sensitive to a wider range of fluctuations in the Earths magnetic field is becoming more and more acceptable to science. The American researcher, Michael Persinger, has put forwards the view that there is a link between some forms of psi activity and fluctuations in the Earths magnetic field. It has been also suggested that part of the Hippocampus region of the brain senses, and distributes to other brain areas, information about electromagnetic fields. Persingers work appears to validate two points; firstly, that the brain can generate electro-magnetic energy, and secondly, that external sources of electro-magnetic energy can affect brain function, giving rise to a wide variety of experienced phenomena. If we can accept this (and there is a growing body of research that bears this out), then suddenly Fra. Choronzons ideas about electro-magnetic structures which have the capacity to order themselves by, and retain information over time, dont sound so far-fetched, do they?

Coming back to the Cthulhu Mythos, it seems then that Lovecraft was on the right track with his themes of weird hillregions, stone circles, barbarous words f power, and frienzied rites. The work of Paul Deveraux and other researchers points to the conclusion that some sacred sites at least, are power spots which predisposed the users towards obtaining an ASC whereby they could interact with energy forms of an electromagnetic nature, doubtless aided by Earth Light anifestations and hallucinogenic substances. Earth Mysteries researcher Paul Bennett has noted that in Britain, as in many other places, a variety of plants which have hallucinogenic properties can be found growing near to sacred sites. The magical dynamics of sound are also a factor, in terms of both the psycho-physical effects upon the participants, and the effect upon external energy sources.

As to the entity Yog-Sothoth, whos appearance in the Mythos triggered this lengthy chain of synthesis; some modern magicians, notably those drawing heavily upon the ideas of Kenneth Grant, have drawn a parallel between Yog-Sothoth and the demon Choronzon, evoked by Aleister Crowley and Victor Neuburg in the Gobi Desert. Again, The Dunwich Horror provides us with a key passage:

The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be, not in the spaces we know, but between them. They walk serene and primal, undimensioned, and to us unseen. Yog Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where they shall break through again. ...They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words have been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons. The wind gibbers with their voices and the earth mutters with their consciousness.

This passage brings to mind the timeslip phenomena discussed above. What is equally, if not more interesting in the light (no pun intended) of the present discussion is that in other Mythos tales, Yog-Sothoth is described as a conglomerate of iridescent globes - in other words, a light form phenomena! The entity is also associated with strange atmospheric effects such as freak winds and storms (Lovecraft is known to have carefully related some of his fictional events with floods, earthquakes, and other such occurrence)s. To me, this stresses further the validity of Lovecrafts dream-inspired fiction as a valid source of magical ideas.

The guidelines to evoking Yog-Sothoth appear, at least as far as The Dunwich Horror sets them forth, to be quite clear and operationally valid. Investigation of the entity has (in my view) suffered from the negative connotations of association with Choronzon as an entity of dispersal, or negative chaos. The emerging science of Chaos Dynamics can perhaps afford us a more positive viewpoint, and the link between Mythos entities and the Mandelbrot Set has already been noted by EOD initiates. From the foregoing, I would suggest that Yog-Sothoth is quite possible a kind of guide entity that appears in many
cultures as the guardian of the underworld entered through ASCs, though one which is capable of manifesting as a series, perhaps, of electro- magnetic phenomena. The entity which coheres in the form we understand as Yog-Sothoth is a window into the darkness of the unknown, and perhaps by creating interfaces, or personae through which we may glean information, we can attain further insights into the way we interact with our universe. Having theorised thus far, what only remains is to go forth and evoke!

Postscript: From the ancient hills I come

This essay is largely the result of reading other peoples research and shaping it together with my own ideas. One event last year however, served to elevate the field of Earth Mysteries from a minor interest to a subject that I am increasingly drawn to. On the night in question, I was with my boyfriend (also a magician), and he returned from the toilet and informed me that there was an entity lurking in the stairwell that leads to my flat. This was unusual, but not sufficiently unusual to cause undue concern and so picking up my thunderbolt, I went out to see what was what. In the stairwell, we both agreed on seeing a black, amorphous shape. Since my friend had first noticed this, I asked him if he would be prepared to try and open his mind to it, so that I could question it, using him as an interface, which was one of his particular talents, and also a fairly accepted procedure for questioning strange entities. The entity declared I have come from the ancient hills. It also stated that it had been awakened only recently, due to activity around a sacred site. It said that it had come to give me power with which I could do something, but was reticent about the exact nature of this. When I asked what it would if I rejected this, it said that it would return, screaming, to the hills. When I asked it to identify itself, it gave the name of Azathoth - which could well have sprung from the mind of my friend, though he had no particular knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos entities. At the time, I found it difficult to credit that such a powerful entity would be hanging politely about in the stairwell, waiting to be noticed. Being unable to obtain a direct answer to my uestioning, I told it to go forth, which it apparently did. I later had to perform an intensive ban ishing ritual upon my friend, who was suffering from symptoms such as feeling cold, a tight pressure on the chest, and personality displacement, and motor spasms. Symptoms such as these have been described by Michael Persinger as possible side-effects of encounters with Earth Light phenomena. Unbeknown to me at the time, (which was later discovered when I related this tale) two friends of mine who were members of the West Yorkshire Earth Mysteries Group had experienced a strange encounter at the then newly-uncovered Backstone Stone Circle. Their experience included seeing Earth Lights, small dwarf-like shades, and lines of energy around the stone circle that they spent a night sitting in. It seems strange, on reflection, that the appearance of the entity claiming to originate from a newly-disturbed site seems to relate to their experience.What this experience did do, was to lead me to making a more intensive study of Earth Mysteries and Magic.

🇯🇵 Evoking Yog-Sothoth

序論
ダゴン秘教団の目的の一つは、グレート・オールド・ワンズと相互作用するための効果的な魔術技術を開発することだ。ヨグ=ソトース・ロッジのピロンの一員として、私はこの存在を具体的な現象として儀式的に召喚する可能性にますます興味を抱くようになった。本論文の目的は、ヨグ=ソトースのような存在と接触するための可能性のある方法論を提示することであり、異なる研究分野の成果を統合し、それらとクトゥルフ神話との関係を考察することである。私は、カバラのような伝統的な魔術システム（もちろん、有用な類推を提供する可能性はあるが）を用いてラヴクラフトのテーマを探求するのではなく、指針を探す最も明らかな場所はラヴクラフトの小説そのものにあると考えている。例えば、『ダンウィッチの恐怖』において、ラヴクラフトは、石の円や不思議な地質現象と関連する「丘の儀式」が、ヨグ=ソトースのような存在に接近する際の鍵であることを明確に示している。グレート・オールド・ワンズを私たちの次元へ呼び込むには、何らかの「ゲート」が必要で、神話物語では、これらはしばしば荒野の屋外サイト、石の円、塔、または同様のパワー・スポットである。ラヴクラフトはまた、これらのサイトが歴史的に、奇妙な現象と関連する長い歴史を持っていることを慎重に指摘している。彼は繰り返し、そのような地域の境界に住む人々の民話に重点を置いている。物語に登場する教育を受けた懐疑論者が嘲笑する、現地の住民の伝統だ。
特定の地域に長い奇妙な現象の歴史があるというテーマは、よく記録されている。ジョン・キールは『時間と空間からの奇妙な生物』で、特定の地域に限定されたように見える奇妙な生物の出現に関する複数の事例を調査している。その一例が、1966年から1968年にウェストバージニア州で発生した「モスマンの目撃例」だ。イギリスEODの初心者にとってより興味深い地域は、イルクリー・ムーアかもしれない。この地域は、幽霊や黒い犬からUFO、現代の地球神秘学の研究者が「アースライト」と呼ぶ現象まで、長い歴史と詳細な記録を持つ不思議な現象の発生地として知られている。
アースライト現象は、主にポール・デヴェロックスの著作から生まれた。彼は『The Ley Hunter』の編集者であり、『The Dragon Project』の共同設立者だ。彼の理論は、地球が自然プロセスによって多様な光形態を生成するという事実に基づいている。これらの「説明不能な」光形態は、目撃者によってUFOや霊的現象と解釈されてきた。これらの現象の発生は、特定の地域に特有であることが多く、光はしばしば車に「追従」したり、観察者によって「導かれているように」または「知性を持っているように」行動すると報告されている。デヴェロックスは、EL現象の発生が、観察者によって「白い女性」型の幽霊と解釈されるガス状の物質の柱と関連している場合があると指摘している。地球の謎を研究する研究者たちは、このような光現象の起源は地球のテクトニック活動にあり、断層線に沿ったストレスが他の要因と組み合わさって、断層線周辺の地域で光現象を発生させると仮説を立てている。デヴェロックスは、中世の錫や銅の鉱山労働者が、新しい鉱山を探索する際、地面から発する光を探していたと指摘している。1984年にイルクリー・ムーア周辺で発生したUFOの「フラップ」は、この理論を裏付けるものとして注目されている。この現象は、その地域でマグニチュード5.5の異常な地震が発生した後に起こったからだ。光現象（一般的にUFOと認識される）を目撃した人々の報告の一部では、その出現パターンが地域の下を走る断層線のパターンと一致していたとされている。デヴェロックスの著書『アース・ライツ・レベレーション』は、世界中のこのような活動を調査し、UFO目撃と地質断層の強い関連性を指摘している。多くのUFO研究者は、UFO遭遇の一部を純粋な地球現象として説明するアース・ライツ理論を否定しているが、アース・ミステリーズ研究は、デヴェロックスのアイデアを支持しさらに深めるための証拠の記録を継続している。
地球の光の目撃報告と、特定の地域や地下活動との関連性を読むことは、私にとって、ラヴクラフトの「偉大なる古き者たち」に関連する活動に関する記述を想起させる。現代の魔術師にとって重要なのは、石の円形遺跡や他の聖地が、地質学的断層が存在する地域に頻繁に位置していることだ。デヴェロックスは、これらの場所が自然の光現象を強化し集中させる役割を果たした可能性を提唱している。世界中に、ウィル・オ・ザ・ウィスプから妖精、幽霊、そして最近ではUFOまで、地球の光現象と関連する民話が豊富に存在する。
蝶からベエルゼブブへ
私は、イリュミネイツ・オブ・タナテロスのフラ・コロゾンによる最近の探求に深く感謝している。特に、カオス数学と魔術的実体との関係に関する彼の明快な説明に感謝している。フラ・コロゾンは「カオス召喚」と題したエッセイで次のように書いている： 
「私たちは皆、電磁波の定常波の変調によって情報が一か所から別の場所へ転送されることを知っている。私は、情報が電磁的特性を有するトーラス状（ドーナツ形）の構造体内で保存または転送される可能性についても考えてほしい。」
Choronzonはさらに、このような秩序立った構造は、気体や液体の挙動を支配するカオス数学から自然に生じるものだと示唆している。この最もよく知られた例は、木星の大気中に現れる大きな赤斑だろう。彼は、吹き出した煙の輪がそのような構造の例だと挙げ、非喫煙者でも唇からガスの輪を大気中に投影し、それが大気中に定着する可能性があると指摘している。ただし、その存在は通常の基準では検出不可能だ。チョロンゾンは、少なくとも一部に電磁気的性質を持つこのような構造が、地球の磁場内に存在することが数学的に可能だと提案している。また、神経系における神経化学活動という形でエネルギーを消費することで、このような構造を発生させることも可能だと提案している。要するに、魔術師が儀式で用いるような生理学的知識が、このようなトーラス構造を生成する可能性があるということだ。
上記は、魔術師と地球の神秘を研究する研究者双方にとって興味深い含意を持つ。過去1年間、私は召喚された実体の創造、使用、および発生原因に関する広範な研究を行ってきた。これには、ゴエティアの悪魔的な形態と、魔術師が特定の任務を遂行するために創造した「エレメンタル・サーヴァント」が含まれる。後者の場合、プロセスは「情報マトリックス」の創造に非常に近い。つまり、実体の性質、能力、機能を定義する一連の指示を定めることだ。この情報マトリックスにエネルギーが投影され、実体全体が形成され、その後、創造者から独立して行動できるようになる。このプロセスを純粋に心理的または主観的な説明で説明することは、そのような実体が物理的世界で結果を現す能力（創造者の意図に従って）を説明できない。
ChoronzonのChaos Dynamicsのアイデアに従うと、要素の従属者を召喚し、それによって創造する際に、上記のような構造を存在させている可能性が高いと考えられる。これらの構造が時間を超えて情報を保持する能力があると仮定すれば（少なくとも理論上は）、離散的な「霊」に関連する多様な現象の partial model を提示できるかもしれない。私の経験（および同僚の経験）では、元素の従者に与えられる「仕事」が多ければ多いほど、その「力」は強くなる——確率を操作する能力において、そして最終的に独自の独立した性格を獲得する能力において。創造主の死後も生存する強力な存在は珍しくない。このような存在を創造する人々の数が増えるほど、その生存率と情報貯蔵能力も高まる。この観点から、十分な時間とエネルギー（儀式やエネルギーを誘導する他の技術を通じて）を投入された小さな霊が、私たちが一般的に「神」と考える存在になる可能性は容易に想像できる。
一時的に話題をそらすが、UFOや霊的遭遇に関連する現象の一部を再考したい。懐疑的な研究者を悩ませる要因の一つは、これらの異常現象と接触した異なる個人間の体験の共通性だ。UFOの「フラップ」に関する歴史的研究は、歴史上、神秘的な霊、飛行船、航空機、潜水艦、そしてもちろん飛行円盤の目撃が集中的に発生したことを示している。また、地球外存在と接触した個人からの数多くの報告では、記憶された（しばしば催眠術を記憶喚起技術として使用して）証言に類似した構造的特徴が見られる。このような現象を扱う際、考慮すべき要因は数多くあるが、後で議論に織り込む目的で、起こっている可能性のあるプロセスの一部について議論したい。
まず、宣言をしておこう。私は、意識が純粋に内部的または主観的な経験であるとは考えていない。むしろ、それは私たちと生物圏全体との相互作用から生じる新興的特性であると主張する。意識と人間の自己参照的意識は、必ずしも同一のものではないと考える。個人が、世界が「あるべき姿」として埋め込まれた構造の外側にあるもの——つまり合意現実——と遭遇する際、私は「信頼性エンベロープ」と呼べる要因が作用し、個人がその経験を合意現実の限界を最も歪めないカテゴリーに「適合」させる仕組みが働くように思われる。 thus、奇妙な遭遇は、宗教的実体、幽霊、または宇宙からの生物との出会いとなる可能性がある。このような存在の有効性に対する意識的な「信念」は必ずしも要因ではない。なぜなら、これらの現象はすべて「未知」の民話の一部であり、情報豊かな文化と、情報を伝達する広範なメディアネットワークのおかげで、個人の無意識の中に「ミーム」（情報の単位）として存在しているからだ。このような体験の調査は、人々が何らかの異常な刺激（例えば不思議な光）を受けると、あらゆる種類の情報を構築する傾向があることを示している。催眠術のような想起技術は、心理的な情報捏造の傾向（無意識の防御機制）により、調査者が期待する情報を多く引き出す傾向があり、これらはまた、このタイプの体験と一般的に関連付けられている情報が無意識に蓄積されていることから導き出される可能性がある。このプロセスの別の例は、いわゆる「サタニック・チャイルド・アブーズ」の生存者の報告で、奇妙な実践の詳細は豊富だが、名前、日付、場所などについては非常に曖昧だ。このような体験で共通するテーマは、個人間の文化的類似性、または人間の脳が知覚を構造化する方法から形成された共通点から生じている可能性もある。
ポール・デヴェロックスは、地球光現象が意識に敏感であるという仮説を提唱している。つまり、エネルギー形態は観察者の意識に敏感であるということだ。地球光の多くの報告では、光が観察者を追いかける、'タグゲームを遊ぶ、または知的に導かれているような特徴を示すと述べられている。これは、魔法現象とフラ・コロゾン氏の「カオス召喚」理論に戻ってくる。グリモワールから霊を召喚する際、私たちはエネルギーを集中させ、情報マトリックスを構築する。このマトリックスは、エネルギーが離散的な実体を生み出すことを可能にする。
この実体は、与えられた情報の範囲内で行動する——実体の特性を定義する情報か、グリモワールに与えられた情報かのいずれかだ。このプロセスは、奇妙な現象（例えばアースライト）とそれを遭遇する個人との相互作用に似ている（ただし、はるかに意図的で方向性がある）。伝統的な理論では、人間と霊の相互作用について、霊は私たちに彼らが本来持たない「個性の特性」を付与するため、人間と相互作用することを好むと繰り返し述べられている。この見方には一理あると感じる。私たちの情報を離散的な全体として組織化し構造化する能力は、このような経験に対処する上で重要な特徴だ。カバラ、アブラ・メリンなど、すべての魔法的心理宇宙は、それらの構造を使用して召喚された実体がどのように振る舞うかに関する一連の指示を与える。
フラ・コロゾンが提唱する、少なくとも部分的に電磁的な性質を持つトーラスの構造に関する考え方を念頭に置くと、このような現象が地球光現象のような出来事と関連している可能性は否定できない。もしそのようなエネルギー形態が、人間の情報マトリックスを創造する能力に反応（または刺激）する場合、あるいは私たちのエネルギー形態との相互作用が、現象の意図的に投影されたか無意識に形成された概念に一致するゲシュタルトとして現れる場合、私たちは
多様な現象を説明するための実用的な方法論に近づいていると言える。フラ・ Choronzonの著作をさらに発展させると、エネルギー形態が、個人または個人の集団との最初の遭遇によって構造的な定義を与えられた後、その定義を時間を超えて保持できると仮定すれば、人々が特定の地域で遭遇する際に「フラップ」し、類似した現象を報告する仕組みが理解できる。要するに、エネルギー形態は構造を与えられると、その情報を保持し、その後その形態と相互作用する他の個人にフィードバックする可能性がある。
ニューロマンサー効果
この仮説に一致する並行現象として、チャネリングがある。エッセイ『Morons From Inner Space？： A Critical Look at Channelled Communications』で、私はチャネリング体験に関与する可能性のあるプロセスの一つをモデル化した：
 
主要なキャラクターの1人は、自身の目的を達成するために人間を操る人工知能だ。これを成功させるためには、操りたい人間との信頼関係を築く必要がある。そのため、接触したい人間の記憶から人格の構築物（マスクのように被る人格）を生成する。これは、自身の経験と人間の知覚限界の間のアクセスポイント（インターフェース）を確立するためだと説明している。この記述は、人間と実体との接触に関する報告を強く連想させた。特に、ディオン・フォーチュンの『コスミック・ドクトリン』にある次の文が印象的だった：
「私たちが何であるかは、あなたには理解できないし、理解しようとしても無駄だ。しかし、あなたは（太字は原文のまま）私たちをアストラル平面上で想像することができ、私たちはあなたの想像を通じてあなたと接触することができる。あなたの心の画像は現実でも実際のものでもないが、その結果は現実的で実際のものだ。」
ディオン・フォーチュンは、内面の世界との接触を広く活用して、彼女の魔術的な思想を体系化した。アラン・リチャードソンは、ディオン・フォーチュンの伝記『Priestess』で、フォーチュンが接触したと主張した歴史上の人物について論じている。最も興味深い存在は「デイビッド・カーソンズ」で、フォーチュンによると、彼は第一次世界大戦中に戦死した若いイギリス軍将校だった。フォーチュンはカーソンズに関する多くの伝記情報を提供したが、徹底的な調査の結果、アラン・リチャードソンはカーソンズは存在しなかったと結論付けた！むしろ、上記のモデルに従えば、彼はディオン・フォーチュンの実験的魔術と経験から生成された人格、つまり情報にアクセスするためのインターフェースであったようだ。あなたの個人的な記憶と知識の総体を空間内の球体——未知の世界——と想像すると、情報領域を拡張するためには、未知の領域や raw data を、知覚の限界内で意味のある情報に翻訳するための「窓」を創造する必要がある。内面界の实体は、この混沌への窓を概念化する方法だ。それらは独立した实体として現れることで、流入するデータを理解可能にする。それらの個性は通常、受取人の信念体系と一致している。そのため、知恵の座がエジプト、シリウスB、またはチベットの寒々しい修道院など、どこにあると信じるかによって、実体の形態は多様になる。通常、これらの存在は、意志と想像力を特定のベクトルに集中させることで自動的に生成されるようですが、まれに意志の行為によって生成される場合もあり、その場合、個人的なアイデアや内なる世界を探索し、最終的に個人の心理宇宙に統合するための「前哨基地」が確立されることがあります。この時点で、体験の現実性に関する問題は崩壊する。なぜなら、これらの存在は病理学的な意味での「二次的人格」ではなく、私たちの情報処理能力とそれ以外の領域との相互作用から生じる新興的な特性だからだ。
上記のモデルは、霊との接触に関連する魔法現象の広範な範囲にも適用可能だと私は思う。人間の、すべてのものを離散的な現象として扱う傾向（おそらく私たちの脳が情報を組織化する特性）が、遭遇するエネルギー形態に「仮面」やペルソナを生成させる。エンティティからのチャネリング通信は、UFO体験や超常現象の副産物としてもよく見られる。私たちのエネルギー形態との相互作用がこのような構造を生み出す可能性もある。つまり、マスクは地球の光の自己参照的な知性からではなく、システム理論の原則——一部のエネルギー形態は、人間の脳が生成する情報場や、車や電力線などから生成される電磁場のような、より高い凝集性を持つ構造 towards 引き寄せられる——から生成され、保持されるのかもしれない。
これらすべてが、私たちをゆっくりとストーンサークル、ラヴクラフトの「丘の上の狂気の儀式」、そして音の役割へと導く。音のダイナミクス、特に意識変容状態（ASC）を引き起こすための異なる発声技術を探求する魔法の文学は数多く存在する。その鍵となる要因の一つがリズムだ。リズムは私たちの意識を導く。心臓の鼓動、呼吸のサイクル、睡眠、昼夜、季節の移り変わりなど、リズムは関連する身体の動きや調整を促進し、意識的な努力なしに動きを始める合図として機能する。
そのため、動きを始める際に消費されるエネルギーが少なくなります。例えば、マーチングバンドの伴奏があると、兵士はより遠くまで、より良い姿勢で、疲労感少なく行進できることが示されています。この「運ばれる」感覚は、リズムが時間感覚に与える構造から生じ、パターンが継続性の感覚を与えるからです。これは運動態度となり、注意が解放される（これが望まれる場合）。リズムは脳の活動によって「鏡のように反映」され、私たちに強力な生理的効果をもたらす。音楽療法士は、失語症やハンチントン病（どちらも言語機能を障害する神経疾患）を患う人々がメロディを歌えることを発見し、グループでの歌は治療的な発声訓練の一般的な要素となっている。人類学者は、幻覚体験における音楽の役割を調査する多くの研究を行ってきた。幻覚誘発薬の使用における音楽の儀式的な付随物としての存在は、広範な文化横断的な基盤で観察される。マルレーヌ・ドブキン・デ・リオスは、著書『Hallucinogens： A Cross-Cultural Perspective』で、幻覚体験における音楽の儀式的な使用が、そのような体験を導くシャーマンが参加者を体験内の重要な経験へと導くための構造を提供する役割を果たすと指摘している。これはヴォドゥンでも見られ、特定のドラムのリズムが特定のラオの現れを告げる。ここから明らかなのは、音が経験に構造を課すこと、特に時間感覚に関してだ。これについては後で詳しく説明する。
フラ・コロゾン氏のカオス召喚に関する研究に戻ると、彼は、彼が説明するトーラスの構造の一つが占める空間に「音の脈動」を注入することで、情報マトリックスが構造に転送されることを指摘している。エノキアン・コール、プリマル・スピーチ、または召喚の野蛮な言葉など、音の力強い発声は、ASC（拡張意識状態）を必然的に引き起こす。これらの技術は、過呼吸、脳活動の増加、頻脈などを引き起こすためだ。魔術師や神秘家たちは、'音は思考を運ぶであり、上級実践者にとって、儀式（または何であれ）の有効性のために発声は必須ではないと広く認められている。重要なのは、意識を特定のベクトルに沿って集中させ、実践者が注意を一点に集中し、それを投影できるASC状態に入ることであり。
音と聖地との関係も、再びポール・デヴェロックスによって研究されている。『ダンウィッチの恐怖』に登場する「丘の騒音」は、聖地の周辺から発せられると報告されており、高音のブザー音、ハミング音、地底から響く「雷鳴」など、多様な音質を示す。『パワーの場所』でデヴェロックスは、一部の巨石遺跡から超音波が放出されている可能性を指摘しているが、この曖昧な発見を裏付けるためにはさらに研究が必要だ。より興味深いのは、デヴェロックスが「シャーマニズムの物理学」と呼ぶものだ。ここで彼は、超常現象（またはPSI現象）と聖地に関連する電磁気的・放射能異常との関連性を説明している。デヴェロックスは、放射線異常に関連する超常体験の特徴の一つとして、時間滑り（タイムスリップ）の感覚を挙げる。これは、個人が時空から切り離され、過去（または未来）の時間を体験する現象だ。時間認識の変容は、魔法の儀式、幻覚剤の使用、UFO遭遇、霊的現象などにおいて共通する特徴だ。これらは、時間が私たちが通常認識するように、私たちに作用する独立した力ではなく、意識そのものの産物である可能性を示唆しています。グノーシス状態において、その状態がどのように引き起こされようと、時間が止まった感覚や、未来、過去、現在が同時に認識される体験は、比較的よく見られます。これは、タイプ4の近接遭遇（人々が宇宙船に連れ去られ、試験（または他の屈辱）を受けたと主張する現象）や、個人が断片的な記憶しか持たずに覚醒する憑依状態の共通の特徴でもある。
魔法の観点から、ASCにおけるこの「ピーク」は、意志を実現するためにエネルギーを投影する最も適切な瞬間である。アースライトの理論と、独自の情報構造を持つトーラスの構造を提唱したフラ・チョロンゾンの理論を組み合わせると、このような現象が「タイムスリップ」体験を引き起こす可能性があり、画像の起源については、様々な推測が可能なのだ。地球の磁場の変動に対して、私たちがより広範囲に敏感である可能性は、科学的にも次第に受け入れられつつある。アメリカの研究者マイケル・ペルシガーは、一部の超常現象と地球の磁場の変動との間に関連性があるという見解を提唱している。また、脳の海馬領域の一部が電磁場に関する情報を感知し、他の脳領域に伝達する可能性も指摘されている。ペルシガーの研究は、2つの点を裏付けるように見える。第一に、脳が電磁エネルギーを生成できること。第二に、外部からの電磁エネルギーが脳機能に影響を与え、多様な「経験される」現象を引き起こす可能性があること。もしこれを認めれば（そして、これを裏付ける研究が徐々に増えている）、突然、フラ。チョロンゾン氏の、自己組織化能力を持ち、時間を超えて情報を保持する電磁構造に関するアイデアは、それほど荒唐無稽には聞こえないだろう？
クトゥルフ神話に戻ると、ラヴクラフトが奇妙な丘陵地帯、石の円環、力を持つ野蛮な言葉、そして「狂乱の儀式」といったテーマで正しい方向性を示していたことがわかる。ポール・デヴェロックスをはじめとする研究者の研究は、少なくとも一部の聖地は、利用者が電磁気的なエネルギー形態と相互作用できるASC（拡張意識状態）を獲得しやすくするパワースポットであり、おそらく地球の光の現れや幻覚誘発物質の助けを借りているという結論を指し示している。地球の神秘研究家ポール・ベネットは、イギリスを含む多くの地域で、神聖な場所の近くで幻覚作用を持つ植物が自生していることを指摘している。音の魔法的なダイナミクスも、参加者の心理物理的効果と外部エネルギー源への影響の両面で要因となっている。
ミソスに登場し、この長い合成の連鎖を引き起こした存在であるヨグ=ソトースについては、ケネス・グラントの思想を強く取り入れた現代の魔術師の一部は、ヨグ=ソトースとアレイスター・クロウリーとヴィクター・ノイブルクがゴビ砂漠で召喚した悪魔クロンゾンとの類似性を指摘している。再び『ダンウィッチの恐怖』が重要な一節を提供している：
「古き者たちはいた、古き者たちはいる、古き者たちはいる。我々が知る空間ではなく、その間にある。彼らは平静で原始的な姿で歩き、次元を超え、我々の目には見えない。ヨグ=ソトースは門を知る。ヨグ=ソトースは門である。ヨグ=ソトースは門の鍵であり、守護者である。過去、現在、未来はすべてヨグ=ソトースにおいて一つだ。彼は古き者たちがかつて突破した場所を知っており、彼らが再び突破する場所も知っている。……彼らは、言葉が語られ、儀式が季節ごとに叫ばれた孤独な場所で、見えないまま、不浄な姿で歩いている。風は彼らの声で呻き、大地は彼らの意識で呟いている。
この一節は、上述の「タイムスリップ」現象を想起させる。現在の議論の光（pun intendedではない）の下で、同様に、あるいはより興味深いのは、他のミソス物語で、ヨグ=ソトースが虹色の球体の集合体——つまり、光現象として描かれていることだ！この存在は、異常な風や嵐などの奇妙な大気現象とも関連付けられている（ラヴクラフトは、自身のフィクションの出来事を洪水、地震、その他の同様の現象と慎重に関連付けていることで知られている）。私にとって、これはラヴクラフトの夢にインスパイアされたフィクションが、魔法のアイデアの有効な源泉であることをさらに強調している。
ヨグ=ソトースを召喚するためのガイドラインは、『ダンウィッチの恐怖』が示す限りでは、明確で実践可能なもののように見える。この存在の研究は（私の見解では）、分散の实体であるクロンゾンとの関連から生じる否定的な連想により、損なわれてきた。カオス動力学の新たな科学は、私たちによりポジティブな視点を提供できるかもしれない。ミソス存在とマンデルブロ集合の関連性は、EODの初期メンバーによって既に指摘されている。以上のことから、私はヨグ=ソトースが、ASCを通じて地下世界への入り口として現れる「守護者」としての役割を果たす存在であり、おそらくはシリーズとして現れる電磁現象の連鎖として具現化する可能性のある、一種の「ガイド」存在である可能性が高いと提案する。
文化において、ASCを通じてアクセスされる地下世界の「守護者」として現れる可能性が高いと考えられる。ただし、この存在は、おそらく電磁現象の連鎖として現れる能力を持つものかもしれない。私たちがヨグ=ソトースとして理解する形態で凝縮する存在は、未知の暗闇への「窓」であり、インターフェースやペルソナを通じて情報を得ることにより、私たちが宇宙と相互作用する方法をさらに理解する可能性を秘めている。ここまで理論化した以上、残るは実践に移すことだけだ！
付記："古代の丘から来た者だ」
このエッセイは、主に他者の研究を読み、私の考えと組み合わせて形にしたものだ。しかし、昨年起きたある出来事が、地球の神秘という分野を、単なる興味の対象から、私がますます惹きつけられるテーマへと昇華させた。その夜、私は彼氏（彼も魔術師だ）と一緒だった。彼がトイレから戻ってきて、私のアパートに通じる階段の踊り場に「存在」が潜んでいると教えてくれた。これは珍しいことだったが、過度に心配するほどではなかったため、私は雷の杖を手に取り、様子を見に行った。階段の踊り場で、私たちは二人とも黒い、形のない影を見たことに同意した。友人が最初に気づいたため、彼に「心を開いて」それとの対話を試みる用意があるか尋ねた。彼をインターフェースとして使い、私が質問する方法は、彼の特技の一つであり、不思議な存在を尋問する際の一般的な手順だった。その存在は「私は古代の丘から来た」と宣言した。また、聖地周辺の活動により最近「覚醒」したとも述べた。私に「力」を与えるために来たが、その正確な性質については控えめだった。私がこれを拒否した場合、どうするかと尋ねると、それは「叫びながら丘に戻っていく」と答えた。名前を尋ねると、それは「アザトース」と名乗った——これは私の友人の頭から生まれた可能性もあるが、彼はクトゥルフ神話の存在について特別な知識はなかった。当時、私は、そのような強力な存在が階段の踊り場で礼儀正しく待っているなどとは信じられなかった。質問に直接答えてもらえなかったため、私はそれを去るように命じた。その後、友人は寒気、胸の圧迫感、人格の変容、運動痙攣などの症状を訴えたため、私は彼に対して集中的な追放儀式を行う必要があった。このような症状は、マイケル・パーシガーによって、地球の光現象との遭遇の可能性がある副作用として記述されている。当時私は知らなかったことだが（後にこの話をした際に判明した）、私の友人2人がウェスト・ヨークシャー・アース・ミステリーズ・グループのメンバーであり、当時新たに発見されたバックストーン・ストーン・サークルで不思議な遭遇を経験していた。彼らの体験には、地球の光、小人のような影、石の円周に現れたエネルギーの線が見え、その場所で一晩を過ごしたことが含まれていた。後から考えると、新しく擾乱された場所から現れたと主張する実体の出現が、彼らの体験と関連しているように思えるのは奇妙だ。この体験は、私を地球の神秘と魔術のより深い研究へと導いた。
